﻿1
00:00:00,141 --> 00:00:01,289
_

2
00:00:01,340 --> 00:00:02,710
You guys are acting like

3
00:00:02,735 --> 00:00:04,569
we're walking towards doomsday here.

4
00:00:04,594 --> 00:00:06,670
It does say, "End of the world party."

5
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:10,496
- He's dead.
- Did anyone see you?

6
00:00:10,532 --> 00:00:12,070
We started a movement!

7
00:00:12,102 --> 00:00:13,804
Get back on a terminal now!

8
00:00:13,828 --> 00:00:15,094
We need to find someone who can do that

9
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:16,229
migration thing he keep talking about.

10
00:00:16,264 --> 00:00:17,497
You play chess?

11
00:00:17,532 --> 00:00:18,965
I'm looking for a good adversary.

12
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,452
Sharon, how do you not
blow your brains out

13
00:00:21,477 --> 00:00:22,554
being married to him?

14
00:00:22,648 --> 00:00:23,680
Do you want to go have a drink?

15
00:00:23,715 --> 00:00:24,968
We're not to be seen together.

16
00:00:25,016 --> 00:00:27,062
You've been parked in the
lot for the past two days.

17
00:00:27,148 --> 00:00:28,093
How long have you been asleep?

18
00:00:28,125 --> 00:00:29,725
There she is... a ray of sunshine

19
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,427
in the dark void of my existence.

20
00:00:31,462 --> 00:00:33,929
Washington Township toxic waste scandal.

21
00:00:33,964 --> 00:00:36,717
You want to take Internet
gossip to federal court

22
00:00:36,742 --> 00:00:39,043
and throw it at the
strongest conglomerate

23
00:00:39,078 --> 00:00:40,335
in the history of civilization.

24
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:43,765
Jim and Saul were both
in the room with Colby

25
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:45,567
covering up the leak in your hometown.

26
00:00:45,602 --> 00:00:48,303
Their lives will be destroyed.

27
00:00:48,338 --> 00:00:53,708
The minute you remove emotion from this,

28
00:00:53,744 --> 00:00:55,143
you'll do just fine.

29
00:01:31,501 --> 00:01:33,968
Trick-or-treat?

30
00:01:34,004 --> 00:01:38,306
Found it in a 99¢ shop in Chinatown.

31
00:01:38,341 --> 00:01:39,874
I didn't know they actually made a mask

32
00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:41,509
from that movie, did you?

33
00:01:43,346 --> 00:01:45,179
When'd you get back to the city?

34
00:01:47,584 --> 00:01:49,617
Well, it's Halloween.

35
00:01:49,653 --> 00:01:51,286
Seeing as though that
used to be our thing,

36
00:01:51,321 --> 00:01:52,787
I thought I'd hit you up.

37
00:01:54,691 --> 00:01:57,926
"Great, Darlene, haven't seen
you in a long time either.

38
00:01:57,961 --> 00:01:59,761
I'd love to hang out."

39
00:02:01,965 --> 00:02:04,265
Next time you should call first.

40
00:02:04,301 --> 00:02:06,134
I'm going out.

41
00:02:06,169 --> 00:02:07,635
Come on.

42
00:02:07,671 --> 00:02:09,337
You don't go out.

43
00:02:11,708 --> 00:02:13,441
I don't mean that in a cunty way.

44
00:02:13,476 --> 00:02:15,677
I just mean, you know,

45
00:02:15,712 --> 00:02:17,612
you're you.

46
00:02:19,549 --> 00:02:21,916
Look, if this is you
needing a place to stay,

47
00:02:21,952 --> 00:02:23,151
then you can crash on the couch.

48
00:02:23,186 --> 00:02:24,519
Init 1.

49
00:02:28,391 --> 00:02:31,392
I wouldn't say that if I
wasn't being serious.

50
00:02:32,963 --> 00:02:34,529
Please.

51
00:02:34,564 --> 00:02:37,999
Hang out with me tonight.

52
00:02:38,034 --> 00:02:39,801
For real. I need this.

53
00:02:54,651 --> 00:02:56,517
Do you have to wear that grody old mask?

54
00:02:56,553 --> 00:02:59,020
- It's totally nasty.
- It's father's.

55
00:02:59,055 --> 00:03:01,622
He wore it on his yacht
five New Years ago.

56
00:03:01,658 --> 00:03:03,624
We were a mile off Catalina?

57
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:06,394
Duh, it was the night uncle
Conrad threw himself overboard.

58
00:03:06,429 --> 00:03:08,162
All because Dad got the business.

59
00:03:08,198 --> 00:03:10,031
Boo-hoo.

60
00:03:10,066 --> 00:03:12,166
I mean, clearly what the film is
doing is debunking the notion

61
00:03:12,202 --> 00:03:15,136
that American society is classless.

62
00:03:15,171 --> 00:03:17,705
Meritocracy my ass.

63
00:03:17,741 --> 00:03:20,341
Long live the oligarchy!

64
00:03:20,377 --> 00:03:22,010
Whatever, can you just
take the mask off?

65
00:03:22,045 --> 00:03:23,144
It's freaking me out.

66
00:03:23,179 --> 00:03:24,979
God.

67
00:03:25,015 --> 00:03:27,181
It's like us and the three
seeders are the only idiots

68
00:03:27,217 --> 00:03:30,385
to actually watch this thing growing up.

69
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:31,719
This is definitely the root

70
00:03:31,755 --> 00:03:34,255
of all our psychological dysfunction.

71
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:36,524
- Fashionably late.
- Screw that.

72
00:03:36,559 --> 00:03:39,594
I hate our friends.

73
00:03:39,629 --> 00:03:43,531
You still having them?

74
00:03:43,566 --> 00:03:47,035
Why is that always your go-to with me?

75
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:49,203
I mean, trust me, in this day and age,

76
00:03:49,239 --> 00:03:52,273
it's sicker not having panic attacks.

77
00:03:52,308 --> 00:03:55,176
Since when did pretending
everything's okay

78
00:03:55,211 --> 00:03:57,945
suddenly become the almighty norm?

79
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:02,183
I can write you a check.

80
00:04:07,657 --> 00:04:09,290
Okay, I don't normally say this,

81
00:04:09,325 --> 00:04:13,227
but I have got to Instagram this.

82
00:04:13,263 --> 00:04:15,463
People need to know this movie exists.

83
00:04:24,274 --> 00:04:27,275
I'm really into papadam these days.

84
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:30,478
What about you? You want to do Indian?

85
00:04:30,513 --> 00:04:33,081
I hacked Postmates' proxy
that supports the APN

86
00:04:33,116 --> 00:04:35,283
for my boyfriend's cell carrier.

87
00:04:35,318 --> 00:04:38,386
Now it does a URL rewrite and
sends every postmates.com

88
00:04:38,421 --> 00:04:40,088
request to my affiliate link,

89
00:04:40,123 --> 00:04:42,590
meaning I get $10 coupons

90
00:04:42,625 --> 00:04:44,859
every time a sucker orders anything.

91
00:04:49,799 --> 00:04:51,232
What's your deal?

92
00:04:51,267 --> 00:04:54,836
That lame infosec gig
scared you straight?

93
00:04:54,871 --> 00:04:57,672
No, man.

94
00:04:57,707 --> 00:04:59,207
Got fired.

95
00:05:03,713 --> 00:05:06,214
Now I'm seeing a shrink.

96
00:05:08,384 --> 00:05:10,818
Hold the fuck up.

97
00:05:10,854 --> 00:05:13,454
What does a shrink have to do with this?

98
00:05:15,058 --> 00:05:18,326
I was on this project, pen testing.

99
00:05:18,361 --> 00:05:22,697
Kept finding holes in the system.

100
00:05:22,732 --> 00:05:26,767
Wasn't my fault they
sucked, but it was my job

101
00:05:26,803 --> 00:05:30,505
to keep hacking till
it was hacker-proof.

102
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:35,143
I think it was the night
of Memorial Day weekend.

103
00:05:35,178 --> 00:05:39,380
Everybody wanted to go home...

104
00:05:39,415 --> 00:05:42,650
to their parties, their clubs,

105
00:05:42,685 --> 00:05:44,852
their vacations.

106
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:49,991
But they couldn't.

107
00:05:50,026 --> 00:05:53,628
Because of me.

108
00:05:53,663 --> 00:05:55,630
So when they couldn't
lock down the servers

109
00:05:55,665 --> 00:05:58,966
they decided to lock
down my ass instead,

110
00:05:59,002 --> 00:06:01,536
in the server room.

111
00:06:03,206 --> 00:06:07,074
After a few hours, I fell asleep.

112
00:06:08,745 --> 00:06:10,344
Woke up.

113
00:06:14,217 --> 00:06:18,819
All the servers in the
room were destroyed.

114
00:06:18,855 --> 00:06:20,955
I didn't remember doing it.

115
00:06:22,859 --> 00:06:24,892
Judge made me go to therapy

116
00:06:24,928 --> 00:06:27,862
for anger management.

117
00:06:38,107 --> 00:06:39,941
Guess it's official.

118
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:45,913
I'm crazy.

119
00:06:49,419 --> 00:06:51,352
You want to know who's crazy?

120
00:06:51,387 --> 00:06:54,855
Those Wall Street psychos.

121
00:06:54,891 --> 00:06:58,359
Okay? You'll find something better.

122
00:06:58,394 --> 00:07:01,629
Angela's trying to hook me
up with a job at Allsafe.

123
00:07:07,837 --> 00:07:10,905
You see Mom?

124
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:14,642
Not really. You?

125
00:07:14,677 --> 00:07:16,811
Fuck no.

126
00:07:16,846 --> 00:07:19,680
She still shits on Dad
every time I talk to her.

127
00:07:28,458 --> 00:07:30,458
I wish I remembered him better.

128
00:07:38,101 --> 00:07:40,134
You want to see something?

129
00:07:56,219 --> 00:07:59,153
Holy shit.

130
00:07:59,188 --> 00:08:00,588
Is this...

131
00:08:04,227 --> 00:08:07,628
Put it on.

132
00:08:07,664 --> 00:08:08,963
Put it on.

133
00:08:22,979 --> 00:08:24,712
Oh, yeah... okay, wait.

134
00:08:28,017 --> 00:08:29,483
Put this on too.

135
00:08:32,155 --> 00:08:33,354
Why?

136
00:08:33,389 --> 00:08:35,356
Because I asked you to.

137
00:09:14,797 --> 00:09:19,700
Maybe I should take the job at Allsafe.

138
00:09:19,736 --> 00:09:21,669
I could be a Trojan horse.

139
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:28,576
Be a good way to take them down.

140
00:09:28,611 --> 00:09:29,844
Who?

141
00:09:35,985 --> 00:09:37,451
Evil Corp.

142
00:09:40,423 --> 00:09:42,690
Okay.

143
00:09:45,795 --> 00:09:48,963
I can't tell if you're
joking behind that mask.

144
00:09:53,569 --> 00:09:56,971
With the right access,

145
00:09:57,006 --> 00:09:59,740
install the right malware...

146
00:10:02,011 --> 00:10:05,079
Trash their backups,

147
00:10:05,114 --> 00:10:08,816
we could corrupt all their data.

148
00:10:08,851 --> 00:10:11,652
I bet it wouldn't even be that hard.

149
00:10:11,687 --> 00:10:13,320
No.

150
00:10:13,356 --> 00:10:16,490
No, the hard part would be after,

151
00:10:16,526 --> 00:10:18,325
during the fallout.

152
00:10:18,361 --> 00:10:20,494
That's the key.

153
00:10:20,530 --> 00:10:22,596
The follow through.

154
00:10:22,632 --> 00:10:25,499
They'd have an opportunity to reset,

155
00:10:25,535 --> 00:10:27,334
rebuild their database.

156
00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:29,470
We couldn't let them.

157
00:10:29,505 --> 00:10:32,940
It'd be tempting to lay
off them afterwards,

158
00:10:32,975 --> 00:10:35,943
but that's when you
have to go in for more.

159
00:10:35,978 --> 00:10:37,611
The public's confidence in them

160
00:10:37,647 --> 00:10:39,747
would have to be completely destroyed

161
00:10:39,782 --> 00:10:42,116
in order to really finish them off.

162
00:10:47,623 --> 00:10:49,957
That's the only way it would work.

163
00:10:52,962 --> 00:10:54,929
Dude, you're freaking me out.

164
00:10:57,967 --> 00:10:59,333
I mean, don't get me wrong.

165
00:10:59,368 --> 00:11:00,668
Taking them down would...

166
00:11:00,703 --> 00:11:02,036
Change the world.

167
00:11:08,478 --> 00:11:12,680
Is this something you've
actually thought about?

168
00:11:36,839 --> 00:11:38,906
You there?

169
00:12:07,515 --> 00:12:13,515
- sync and corrections by Caio -
- www.MY-SUBS.com -

170
00:13:33,723 --> 00:13:36,357
God.

171
00:13:36,392 --> 00:13:40,494
I will never understand
why you did this.

172
00:13:40,529 --> 00:13:44,465
Asking for help was never
Darlene's strong suit.

173
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:47,034
But then again, is it anyone's?

174
00:13:47,069 --> 00:13:49,269
An admission of weakness.

175
00:13:49,305 --> 00:13:51,872
But you can't avoid the simple truth.

176
00:13:51,907 --> 00:13:53,874
The only way to patch a vulnerability

177
00:13:53,909 --> 00:13:55,676
is by exposing it first.

178
00:13:55,711 --> 00:13:58,379
It's good for me here.

179
00:13:58,414 --> 00:14:02,282
Better than back at my place.

180
00:14:02,318 --> 00:14:03,951
It's cool.

181
00:14:03,986 --> 00:14:06,220
I mean, I don't get it,

182
00:14:06,255 --> 00:14:08,022
but I don't have to.

183
00:14:08,057 --> 00:14:11,191
The flip side being that
exposing a vulnerability

184
00:14:11,227 --> 00:14:13,560
leaves you open for an exploit.

185
00:14:15,698 --> 00:14:17,965
I have to tell you something.

186
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,900
It's pretty fucking mental though,

187
00:14:19,935 --> 00:14:23,037
and I don't know if you're
gonna be able to deal

188
00:14:23,072 --> 00:14:26,040
after the whole Gideon thing.

189
00:14:26,075 --> 00:14:29,510
I know what you've been doing, Darlene.

190
00:14:29,545 --> 00:14:32,046
I see the news.

191
00:14:32,081 --> 00:14:34,248
That's not even the half of it.

192
00:14:34,283 --> 00:14:36,316
You need to stop.

193
00:14:36,352 --> 00:14:39,420
It's too dangerous.

194
00:14:39,455 --> 00:14:41,689
Don't give me that.

195
00:14:41,724 --> 00:14:43,557
The things we're doing, Elliot...

196
00:14:43,592 --> 00:14:46,026
the things I'm doing to
complete our mission...

197
00:14:46,062 --> 00:14:48,228
you'd be proud if you only knew.

198
00:14:48,264 --> 00:14:50,864
We have something big planned
for the bailout vote in D.C.

199
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:53,167
No.

200
00:14:53,202 --> 00:14:54,535
No more.

201
00:14:56,972 --> 00:14:58,672
We're on the other side of something

202
00:14:58,708 --> 00:15:00,874
we never signed up for.

203
00:15:03,212 --> 00:15:05,546
My boss was killed.

204
00:15:05,581 --> 00:15:07,848
I mean, what did you guys expect

205
00:15:07,883 --> 00:15:10,551
was gonna happen, exactly?

206
00:15:10,586 --> 00:15:12,720
You thought everything was
gonna be hunky-fucking-dory?

207
00:15:12,755 --> 00:15:15,556
They'd go quietly into the night?

208
00:15:15,591 --> 00:15:18,859
You said it yourself
before we even started.

209
00:15:18,894 --> 00:15:23,230
The hard part would be after,
not the during or before.

210
00:15:29,105 --> 00:15:30,571
That wasn't me.

211
00:15:33,342 --> 00:15:34,708
That was him.

212
00:15:40,583 --> 00:15:44,818
Well, then maybe I need him right now,

213
00:15:44,854 --> 00:15:47,888
because what I'm seeing in front of me

214
00:15:47,923 --> 00:15:50,724
isn't helping.

215
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:53,827
She's not telling me something.

216
00:15:53,863 --> 00:15:55,462
She wants my help,

217
00:15:55,498 --> 00:15:58,232
but she's not being honest about what.

218
00:15:58,267 --> 00:16:00,334
This is what she does.

219
00:16:00,369 --> 00:16:03,337
I mean, the things
we're doing, Elliot...

220
00:16:03,372 --> 00:16:04,671
This is her default.

221
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:14,248
All right, I'm gonna show you
something in here first.

222
00:16:17,653 --> 00:16:19,586
Found it kind of curious
he only printed out

223
00:16:19,622 --> 00:16:22,289
a few pages of the FBI roster.

224
00:16:22,324 --> 00:16:24,158
Turned out there was a name on each page

225
00:16:24,193 --> 00:16:26,794
from the New York office, including me.

226
00:16:26,829 --> 00:16:28,195
Common thread among them

227
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:29,997
was that we all interviewed
Gideon Goddard.

228
00:16:30,032 --> 00:16:31,532
Still don't know what it means.

229
00:16:34,737 --> 00:16:36,470
They were definitely stealing power.

230
00:16:36,505 --> 00:16:39,506
They found a cable running
from a municipal power source.

231
00:16:39,542 --> 00:16:41,108
We're still looking into Internet.

232
00:16:48,651 --> 00:16:50,984
The whole party was on social media.

233
00:16:53,255 --> 00:16:55,956
You really like this place for our guys?

234
00:16:55,991 --> 00:16:58,458
An arcade with the goddamn sign outside?

235
00:16:58,494 --> 00:17:00,694
They're hackers. Brazen.

236
00:17:00,729 --> 00:17:03,163
They believe in hiding in plain sight.

237
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:04,798
This is just...

238
00:17:04,834 --> 00:17:07,134
too stupid.

239
00:17:07,169 --> 00:17:08,402
Well, what does that say about us, then,

240
00:17:08,437 --> 00:17:10,103
that we're just now finding it?

241
00:17:12,675 --> 00:17:14,842
We're bringing in all the
people from these photos,

242
00:17:14,877 --> 00:17:17,177
cross-checking all social
media, Facebook, Twitter.

243
00:17:17,213 --> 00:17:19,213
So they threw a party. So what?

244
00:17:19,248 --> 00:17:20,480
Everyone threw one of these

245
00:17:20,516 --> 00:17:22,549
"end of the world" parties that night.

246
00:17:22,585 --> 00:17:24,051
What about the flyer?

247
00:17:24,086 --> 00:17:26,553
We checked on the DJ name, Mobley.

248
00:17:26,589 --> 00:17:28,555
Appears to be a DJ out in Vegas.

249
00:17:28,591 --> 00:17:30,891
Just your average,
middle-of-the-road player.

250
00:17:30,926 --> 00:17:32,693
Nobody of note.

251
00:17:32,728 --> 00:17:34,728
He was doing a show out there
at Caesar's that night.

252
00:17:34,763 --> 00:17:36,997
It checks. I'm not sure
of the connection.

253
00:17:37,032 --> 00:17:39,233
Why don't you just break
it down for us, Dom?

254
00:17:39,268 --> 00:17:42,202
What hard evidence do
we actually have here?

255
00:17:47,243 --> 00:17:48,542
Found this tucked behind

256
00:17:48,577 --> 00:17:50,244
that "Mallard Murder" game over there.

257
00:17:53,315 --> 00:17:55,449
How do you know no one followed you?

258
00:17:55,484 --> 00:17:57,851
They think I'm in a yoga class.

259
00:17:57,887 --> 00:17:58,887
Trust me.

260
00:17:58,888 --> 00:18:02,389
He's very good at this.

261
00:18:02,424 --> 00:18:04,124
This is no way to live.

262
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:06,226
They keep asking me questions,

263
00:18:06,262 --> 00:18:08,061
over and over.

264
00:18:08,097 --> 00:18:09,796
They don't stop coming back.

265
00:18:09,832 --> 00:18:12,366
I promise you. You're safe.

266
00:18:12,401 --> 00:18:13,967
I don't feel it.

267
00:18:14,003 --> 00:18:15,302
I don't feel it.

268
00:18:15,337 --> 00:18:17,237
I should have never agreed to this.

269
00:18:17,273 --> 00:18:20,741
Kareem, tell me what
this is really about.

270
00:18:20,776 --> 00:18:22,643
I've paid you well every week.

271
00:18:22,678 --> 00:18:25,545
What good is that to
me if I'm dead, huh?

272
00:18:25,581 --> 00:18:27,314
Look what happened to the Allsafe guy.

273
00:18:27,349 --> 00:18:29,416
They could kill me too!

274
00:18:29,451 --> 00:18:31,418
I should have never got
mixed up with you.

275
00:18:31,453 --> 00:18:34,187
I should have just came
clean from the jump.

276
00:18:41,530 --> 00:18:43,297
My husband will return soon,

277
00:18:43,332 --> 00:18:45,299
and this will all be over.

278
00:18:45,334 --> 00:18:46,800
Listen.

279
00:18:46,835 --> 00:18:48,802
I'ma keep telling your story, all right?

280
00:18:48,837 --> 00:18:51,071
But if shit goes down and I get busted,

281
00:18:51,106 --> 00:18:52,406
I'm not gonna get locked up.

282
00:18:52,441 --> 00:18:54,107
You feel me?

283
00:18:54,143 --> 00:18:57,010
They lowered the daily
allowance to 50 bucks a day.

284
00:18:57,046 --> 00:18:59,313
That's no way to live; I
can't live like that.

285
00:19:38,754 --> 00:19:40,253
Speak.

286
00:19:40,278 --> 00:19:43,747
Ma'am, we're running low on funds.

287
00:19:44,026 --> 00:19:47,294
I don't know how much
longer we can afford.

288
00:19:47,329 --> 00:19:49,029
E Corp still hasn't
released your husband's

289
00:19:49,064 --> 00:19:50,564
severance package.

290
00:19:50,599 --> 00:19:52,866
The FBI was specifically told not

291
00:19:52,901 --> 00:19:54,134
to put a hold on any of that money...

292
00:19:54,169 --> 00:19:57,371
It's not the FBI, ma'am.

293
00:19:57,406 --> 00:20:00,173
We can't afford to keep this guy quiet.

294
00:20:03,379 --> 00:20:04,911
I'm done with this topic.

295
00:20:20,195 --> 00:20:23,397
I place myself in alignment
with the things I want.

296
00:20:23,713 --> 00:20:27,368
I place myself in alignment
with the things I want.

297
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:34,498
I dissolve all false messages.

298
00:20:34,533 --> 00:20:37,534
I dissolve all false messages.

299
00:20:43,275 --> 00:20:47,044
My beliefs create my own reality.

300
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:50,914
My beliefs create my own reality.

301
00:20:55,788 --> 00:21:00,090
All of my dreams are
coming true right now.

302
00:21:00,126 --> 00:21:03,427
All of my dreams are
coming true right now.

303
00:21:18,244 --> 00:21:19,244
Hmm.

304
00:21:19,245 --> 00:21:22,413
Not gonna lie.

305
00:21:22,448 --> 00:21:24,982
You could use some practice.

306
00:21:38,364 --> 00:21:40,030
Your move.

307
00:21:44,103 --> 00:21:46,670
You know the definition of insanity?

308
00:21:46,705 --> 00:21:49,306
He clearly doesn't know
who he's talking to.

309
00:21:49,341 --> 00:21:51,809
Rather than repeating your mistakes,

310
00:21:51,844 --> 00:21:55,746
you should develop your game a bit.

311
00:21:55,781 --> 00:21:57,648
And you're gonna teach me?

312
00:21:57,683 --> 00:21:59,917
No.

313
00:21:59,952 --> 00:22:01,985
You are.

314
00:22:02,021 --> 00:22:03,253
Take the board.

315
00:22:03,289 --> 00:22:04,922
Play yourself.

316
00:22:04,957 --> 00:22:06,356
Practice.

317
00:22:06,392 --> 00:22:08,125
Who knows, you might beat yourself.

318
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:14,264
What's the point of that?

319
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:19,269
Because there's something on your mind.

320
00:22:19,305 --> 00:22:22,639
It's been there since I first met you.

321
00:22:22,675 --> 00:22:24,374
What?

322
00:22:24,410 --> 00:22:26,477
Like I was behind the
biggest hack in the world,

323
00:22:26,512 --> 00:22:28,011
which also led to the death of my...

324
00:22:28,047 --> 00:22:31,482
I can tell you're thinking
about it right now.

325
00:22:31,517 --> 00:22:33,217
And it burdens you.

326
00:22:33,252 --> 00:22:35,786
No shit, it burdens me.

327
00:22:35,821 --> 00:22:38,222
But I'm trapped by it, aren't I?

328
00:22:41,227 --> 00:22:45,362
Look, I'm no Catholic, but I
do believe in confession.

329
00:22:45,397 --> 00:22:49,466
I've done some dark shit myself,

330
00:22:49,502 --> 00:22:53,070
and it took real...

331
00:22:53,105 --> 00:22:54,304
cleansing

332
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:57,040
to get me through it.

333
00:22:57,076 --> 00:22:59,843
I can help, if you want.

334
00:23:02,114 --> 00:23:05,582
What you say to me stays here.

335
00:23:07,853 --> 00:23:10,220
Talking doesn't really help me.

336
00:23:12,525 --> 00:23:16,660
You can't keep the talking
just in your head, bro.

337
00:23:16,695 --> 00:23:20,531
At some point, you got to
try to make sense of it.

338
00:23:20,566 --> 00:23:22,733
What if I do tell him

339
00:23:22,768 --> 00:23:25,602
everything about what I did?

340
00:23:25,638 --> 00:23:28,739
Krista doesn't even know that much.

341
00:23:28,774 --> 00:23:32,509
What if I could talk
to someone about this?

342
00:23:32,545 --> 00:23:34,411
Maybe he's right.

343
00:23:34,446 --> 00:23:36,346
Maybe it could help.

344
00:23:36,382 --> 00:23:38,048
Finally unburden me from...

345
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:39,750
You tell him anything,

346
00:23:39,785 --> 00:23:42,052
and I will personally find the
tallest building in the city

347
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:43,253
and swan dive off of it.

348
00:23:43,289 --> 00:23:45,355
Ray has a point.

349
00:23:45,391 --> 00:23:47,257
I can't hold this in any longer.

350
00:23:47,293 --> 00:23:48,759
It's eating away at me.

351
00:23:48,794 --> 00:23:50,561
You confess, he goes to the law.

352
00:23:50,596 --> 00:23:52,396
So what?

353
00:23:52,431 --> 00:23:55,098
I'm okay with being on the hook.

354
00:23:55,134 --> 00:23:56,934
I'll own it all.

355
00:23:56,969 --> 00:23:58,402
And maybe it'll even stop Darlene

356
00:23:58,437 --> 00:24:00,771
from doing any more crazy shit.

357
00:24:00,806 --> 00:24:02,773
At this rate, she's gonna
end up just like Gideon...

358
00:24:02,808 --> 00:24:04,441
What do you think the
Dark Army's gonna do

359
00:24:04,476 --> 00:24:06,810
with the knowledge that
you're all turncoats?

360
00:24:06,845 --> 00:24:08,078
There's no play here.

361
00:24:08,113 --> 00:24:09,313
You want to unburden yourself?

362
00:24:09,348 --> 00:24:10,747
Go jerk off.

363
00:24:10,783 --> 00:24:12,749
This... it's just a road paved

364
00:24:12,785 --> 00:24:15,152
with your dead friends and family.

365
00:24:19,658 --> 00:24:22,893
You need that game a lot
more than I thought.

366
00:24:22,928 --> 00:24:25,262
Jim Chutney, SVP of B.A.,

367
00:24:25,297 --> 00:24:26,597
and Saul Weinberg,

368
00:24:26,632 --> 00:24:28,465
managing director of operations,

369
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:31,168
were arrested in broad daylight
at the E Corp offices.

370
00:24:31,203 --> 00:24:32,603
Both men...

371
00:24:32,638 --> 00:24:36,006
Guys like this, they work in long games.

372
00:24:36,041 --> 00:24:38,275
I gave you information he gave me,

373
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:40,444
and the next day you had
these guys arrested,

374
00:24:40,479 --> 00:24:42,279
which means at every move,

375
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:45,415
he has followed through on
exactly what he's offered.

376
00:24:45,451 --> 00:24:47,951
He's given me everything I wanted.

377
00:24:47,987 --> 00:24:51,088
I have a nice apartment, a nice job.

378
00:24:51,123 --> 00:24:52,789
He had no leverage against me before,

379
00:24:52,825 --> 00:24:55,592
so he created it.

380
00:24:55,628 --> 00:24:57,594
So you're saying everything
he's been doing is

381
00:24:57,630 --> 00:24:59,630
so that he can use it against you?

382
00:24:59,665 --> 00:25:03,367
What about all that stuff you
said about them valuing you?

383
00:25:03,402 --> 00:25:04,935
You're the one that
thought it was suspicious

384
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:06,536
that they offered me a
job in the first place.

385
00:25:06,572 --> 00:25:09,339
I am giving you an explanation.

386
00:25:09,375 --> 00:25:10,841
He's trying to negotiate.

387
00:25:10,876 --> 00:25:13,510
If he's creating leverage,

388
00:25:13,545 --> 00:25:16,013
it means that he needs
something from me.

389
00:25:18,584 --> 00:25:22,686
The drafts of the settlement
negotiations... did you pull them?

390
00:25:22,721 --> 00:25:24,388
Let's look at them together.

391
00:25:24,423 --> 00:25:26,723
There might be something in
there that we're missing.

392
00:25:26,759 --> 00:25:28,225
I don't trust those scam artists

393
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:30,227
at E Corp's risk management division

394
00:25:30,262 --> 00:25:32,329
any more than you do, so I
can assure you if there

395
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:34,531
is something suspicious, our
attorneys would have...

396
00:25:34,566 --> 00:25:36,433
I'm the thing that's missing.

397
00:25:39,297 --> 00:25:41,446
There's something about
me in that agreement.

398
00:25:41,471 --> 00:25:43,282
That's why they haven't found it.

399
00:25:49,365 --> 00:25:52,601
You want to settle this
thing once and for all?

400
00:25:52,636 --> 00:25:54,236
Hmm?

401
00:26:03,981 --> 00:26:06,915
One game.

402
00:26:06,950 --> 00:26:10,719
I'll even let you have the first move.

403
00:26:10,754 --> 00:26:13,788
A game to end all games

404
00:26:13,824 --> 00:26:17,125
between us.

405
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:18,894
We play,

406
00:26:18,929 --> 00:26:24,733
and the winner takes all.

407
00:26:24,768 --> 00:26:28,637
Winner takes all of what?

408
00:26:30,574 --> 00:26:33,275
Us.

409
00:26:33,310 --> 00:26:36,645
You win, you can confess

410
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:38,747
to the JFK assassination for all I care.

411
00:26:38,782 --> 00:26:41,550
I'll leave and never come back.

412
00:26:44,454 --> 00:26:48,256
What would happen if I lose?

413
00:26:48,292 --> 00:26:51,126
You lose,

414
00:26:51,161 --> 00:26:53,328
I get to be in charge

415
00:26:53,363 --> 00:26:55,764
once and for all,

416
00:26:55,799 --> 00:26:57,599
and you?

417
00:26:59,937 --> 00:27:01,570
What about me?

418
00:27:04,608 --> 00:27:08,577
Remember the night of the hack?

419
00:27:08,612 --> 00:27:12,314
Remember what happened to you?

420
00:27:12,349 --> 00:27:15,483
All I remember is, I woke
up in Tyrell Wellick's car

421
00:27:15,519 --> 00:27:18,987
three days later.

422
00:27:19,022 --> 00:27:21,489
And what happened in those three days?

423
00:27:25,028 --> 00:27:28,029
I don't know.

424
00:27:28,065 --> 00:27:29,798
That's what.

425
00:27:33,337 --> 00:27:36,905
The absence of knowing.

426
00:27:38,408 --> 00:27:40,642
Losing time forever.

427
00:27:40,677 --> 00:27:45,380
A deep, black void

428
00:27:45,415 --> 00:27:49,718
that you will never come back from.

429
00:27:49,753 --> 00:27:51,186
No thoughts.

430
00:27:51,221 --> 00:27:52,354
No body.

431
00:27:52,389 --> 00:27:54,356
No memories.

432
00:27:54,391 --> 00:27:58,793
Absolute nothingness.

433
00:28:01,732 --> 00:28:05,567
You're serious?

434
00:28:05,602 --> 00:28:08,903
You think I want this, Elliot?

435
00:28:08,939 --> 00:28:11,373
This futile battle we're in?

436
00:28:11,408 --> 00:28:14,409
Two halves at perpetual war?

437
00:28:16,847 --> 00:28:21,416
I want peace just as much as you do.

438
00:28:21,451 --> 00:28:24,352
Since we can't seem to
find any common ground...

439
00:28:27,424 --> 00:28:28,690
Let's play for it.

440
00:28:33,230 --> 00:28:35,530
What are you thinking about?

441
00:28:37,434 --> 00:28:39,634
I'm thinking about his offer.

442
00:28:44,441 --> 00:28:48,076
Is he the only person you interact with?

443
00:28:48,111 --> 00:28:50,211
Don't worry.

444
00:28:50,247 --> 00:28:52,714
You're safe.

445
00:28:52,749 --> 00:28:53,982
Yes.

446
00:28:56,753 --> 00:28:59,054
Elliot...

447
00:28:59,089 --> 00:29:01,790
do you think I could talk to him?

448
00:29:01,825 --> 00:29:03,458
No.

449
00:29:03,493 --> 00:29:05,460
Why not?

450
00:29:05,495 --> 00:29:07,896
It would legitimize him.

451
00:29:11,835 --> 00:29:14,436
At this point, I think we
have to accept the fact

452
00:29:14,471 --> 00:29:17,739
that he is a legitimate
existence in your life.

453
00:29:17,774 --> 00:29:20,408
That's giving him too much power.

454
00:29:20,444 --> 00:29:21,810
In order for us to figure this out,

455
00:29:21,845 --> 00:29:23,078
we have to acknowledge...

456
00:29:23,113 --> 00:29:25,647
What do you want from me?

457
00:29:25,682 --> 00:29:29,417
You know everything.

458
00:29:29,453 --> 00:29:33,988
You want me to keep repeating myself?

459
00:29:34,024 --> 00:29:38,259
You want me to tell you
that I see my dead father?

460
00:29:38,295 --> 00:29:40,662
That I talk to him?

461
00:29:40,697 --> 00:29:42,764
That sometimes I lose time?

462
00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:44,299
That there are gaps in my life

463
00:29:44,334 --> 00:29:46,101
where I don't know what happened?

464
00:29:46,136 --> 00:29:48,603
That I'm losing my mind?

465
00:29:48,638 --> 00:29:51,840
That I didn't even
recognize my own sister?

466
00:29:51,875 --> 00:29:54,175
That I don't know how
to control this thing?

467
00:29:54,211 --> 00:29:55,677
I don't know how to stop it?

468
00:29:55,712 --> 00:29:56,878
Fine!

469
00:30:05,555 --> 00:30:07,155
Yeah.

470
00:30:07,190 --> 00:30:08,423
Fine.

471
00:30:08,458 --> 00:30:10,058
I acknowledge it.

472
00:30:13,864 --> 00:30:17,332
But let's move on to the part
where you actually help me.

473
00:30:20,837 --> 00:30:24,539
This game you are agreeing
to is dangerous, Elliot.

474
00:30:25,934 --> 00:30:30,603
You are agreeing to destroy
a part of yourself,

475
00:30:30,639 --> 00:30:32,739
win or lose,

476
00:30:32,774 --> 00:30:34,641
so yes, this matters

477
00:30:34,676 --> 00:30:38,411
a great deal, actually.

478
00:30:38,446 --> 00:30:40,480
For better or worse, he is a part of you

479
00:30:40,515 --> 00:30:44,784
that makes you you.

480
00:30:44,819 --> 00:30:47,520
Annihilation is not the answer.

481
00:30:48,957 --> 00:30:51,391
Krista's wrong.

482
00:30:51,426 --> 00:30:54,928
Annihilation is always the answer.

483
00:30:54,963 --> 00:30:57,931
We destroy parts of ourselves every day.

484
00:30:57,966 --> 00:31:00,633
We Photoshop our warts away.

485
00:31:00,669 --> 00:31:03,236
We edit the parts we
hate about ourselves,

486
00:31:03,271 --> 00:31:05,939
modify the parts we think people hate.

487
00:31:05,974 --> 00:31:07,807
We curate our identity,

488
00:31:07,842 --> 00:31:10,610
carve it, distill it.

489
00:31:10,645 --> 00:31:12,679
Krista's wrong.

490
00:31:12,714 --> 00:31:15,014
Annihilation is all we are.

491
00:31:15,050 --> 00:31:17,517
I fail to see the logic.

492
00:31:17,552 --> 00:31:20,520
Why put all your faith in her
when we have other options?

493
00:31:20,555 --> 00:31:21,988
Yes, yes.

494
00:31:22,023 --> 00:31:26,025
We could blow up the whole
Western Hemisphere,

495
00:31:26,061 --> 00:31:28,194
but you know me.

496
00:31:28,229 --> 00:31:29,495
I'm old-fashioned.

497
00:31:29,531 --> 00:31:31,998
I always opt for the simpler path.

498
00:31:32,033 --> 00:31:34,801
Occam's razor and all that.

499
00:31:34,836 --> 00:31:37,870
Be that as it may, it is a slower path,

500
00:31:37,906 --> 00:31:39,639
and time is of the essence, Phillip.

501
00:31:39,674 --> 00:31:41,641
I want to remind you
that closing the plant

502
00:31:41,676 --> 00:31:43,676
is not an option.

503
00:31:48,049 --> 00:31:50,483
And how many minutes have you allotted

504
00:31:50,518 --> 00:31:52,986
for this phone call?

505
00:31:53,021 --> 00:31:55,288
I didn't start this game.

506
00:31:55,323 --> 00:31:57,890
You did.

507
00:31:57,926 --> 00:32:00,193
I'm being pressured to resign.

508
00:32:00,228 --> 00:32:02,395
Confidence in the market
is at an all-time low,

509
00:32:02,430 --> 00:32:04,464
and what are you up to?

510
00:32:04,499 --> 00:32:07,700
You're not doing anything
on your end to help.

511
00:32:07,736 --> 00:32:09,702
I'm handling this.

512
00:32:09,738 --> 00:32:12,338
Just like I said I would.

513
00:32:12,374 --> 00:32:14,507
Have you spoken to the administration?

514
00:32:14,542 --> 00:32:17,076
Mm-mm, we're not there yet.

515
00:32:17,112 --> 00:32:19,412
President isn't desperate enough.

516
00:32:19,447 --> 00:32:21,814
We need the pressure
to cook a little more.

517
00:32:21,850 --> 00:32:25,551
You assured me that the UN
vote would be in full swing.

518
00:32:25,587 --> 00:32:28,488
You're the time master.

519
00:32:28,523 --> 00:32:33,092
You should know that while
Rome may have burned in a day,

520
00:32:33,128 --> 00:32:36,095
it wasn't built in one.

521
00:32:36,131 --> 00:32:40,566
This will take time,

522
00:32:40,602 --> 00:32:42,735
painful as that is for you to hear.

523
00:32:43,810 --> 00:32:45,162
_

524
00:32:45,396 --> 00:32:48,240
_

525
00:32:49,209 --> 00:32:51,771
_

526
00:32:52,388 --> 00:32:56,725
_

527
00:32:58,381 --> 00:33:01,724
_

528
00:33:01,818 --> 00:33:04,771
_

529
00:33:05,553 --> 00:33:08,506
_

530
00:33:11,974 --> 00:33:14,131
_

531
00:33:18,334 --> 00:33:23,342
_

532
00:33:32,146 --> 00:33:33,810
_

533
00:33:34,985 --> 00:33:36,798
_

534
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:43,181
_

535
00:34:16,871 --> 00:34:19,673
Hello, Scott.

536
00:34:19,708 --> 00:34:22,109
Why the fuck are you in my home?

537
00:34:24,847 --> 00:34:27,448
Your housekeeper let me in.

538
00:34:33,001 --> 00:34:36,336
There seems to be a problem with
my husband's severance package.

539
00:34:38,407 --> 00:34:41,207
That sounds like an issue for HR.

540
00:34:41,243 --> 00:34:42,475
Yes.

541
00:34:42,511 --> 00:34:44,744
I've spoken to them already.

542
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:46,546
Several times, in fact.

543
00:34:46,581 --> 00:34:50,016
They claim they can't release it yet.

544
00:34:50,052 --> 00:34:53,720
Yeah, there seems to be
a problem for me, too.

545
00:34:57,526 --> 00:35:00,894
I can't seem to find the
person who murdered my wife.

546
00:35:02,731 --> 00:35:06,466
Bureaucracy is a bitch, right?

547
00:35:09,037 --> 00:35:11,838
You want my husband.

548
00:35:11,873 --> 00:35:14,874
I can understand that.

549
00:35:14,910 --> 00:35:17,510
And I would like the money I'm owed.

550
00:35:17,546 --> 00:35:20,513
So why don't we help each other, then?

551
00:35:20,549 --> 00:35:22,115
I'll testify my husband didn't come home

552
00:35:22,150 --> 00:35:24,718
the night of the murder.

553
00:35:24,753 --> 00:35:26,419
I left the party alone...

554
00:35:26,455 --> 00:35:31,124
didn't see him till the next day.

555
00:35:31,159 --> 00:35:33,960
I'll agree to that if you
release the severance package.

556
00:35:40,502 --> 00:35:42,769
I need that money.

557
00:35:42,804 --> 00:35:44,337
I have a baby.

558
00:35:58,353 --> 00:36:01,988
Tyrell Wellick's baby
gets what it deserves.

559
00:36:04,993 --> 00:36:06,793
Nothing.

560
00:37:03,084 --> 00:37:04,551
Whoa!

561
00:37:04,586 --> 00:37:07,387
- Look out!
- What the hell?

562
00:37:38,286 --> 00:37:41,020
Give me your phone, or I'm walking.

563
00:37:41,056 --> 00:37:42,322
Jesus fucking Christ.

564
00:37:42,357 --> 00:37:44,190
Phone, now!

565
00:37:48,063 --> 00:37:51,531
Go two blocks up and
into The Looking Glass.

566
00:38:14,055 --> 00:38:15,588
Such an asshole.

567
00:38:15,624 --> 00:38:17,257
I had to make sure you weren't followed.

568
00:38:17,292 --> 00:38:18,725
What the hell are you talking about?

569
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:19,760
No one's following me.

570
00:38:19,794 --> 00:38:21,494
The FBI found your arcade.

571
00:38:25,834 --> 00:38:27,267
That doesn't make sense.

572
00:38:27,302 --> 00:38:28,302
- How'd they even know...
- I don't know.

573
00:38:28,303 --> 00:38:29,736
Maybe it has something to do

574
00:38:29,771 --> 00:38:32,438
with the dead hacker they
found the other day?

575
00:38:32,474 --> 00:38:34,641
Yeah, I know about that, too.

576
00:38:47,422 --> 00:38:49,389
Okay, you got to tell me,
and tell me right now.

577
00:38:49,424 --> 00:38:52,091
Is this Dark Army?

578
00:38:52,127 --> 00:38:54,961
Look, I can promise you from
the communications I've seen

579
00:38:54,996 --> 00:38:58,131
that it's just... it's
no way that it's them.

580
00:38:58,166 --> 00:38:59,933
There's just nothing in it for 'em.

581
00:39:02,771 --> 00:39:06,172
What's Elliot say about all this?

582
00:39:06,207 --> 00:39:08,808
He doesn't know about Romero.

583
00:39:08,843 --> 00:39:11,010
He's in a fragile state.

584
00:39:11,046 --> 00:39:12,679
We're past fragile, okay?

585
00:39:12,714 --> 00:39:15,148
This shit that we're in
has fucking shattered

586
00:39:15,183 --> 00:39:18,451
into a million little pieces.

587
00:39:18,486 --> 00:39:20,520
You got to tell him.

588
00:39:26,328 --> 00:39:28,895
What are you doing here?

589
00:39:33,335 --> 00:39:37,303
I wanted to make sure you were okay.

590
00:39:37,339 --> 00:39:38,605
Oh.

591
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:41,441
Well, I am the fucking opposite of okay,

592
00:39:41,476 --> 00:39:43,343
so tough shit.

593
00:39:46,848 --> 00:39:48,047
Hey...

594
00:39:48,083 --> 00:39:50,016
You want to help?

595
00:39:50,051 --> 00:39:53,019
Be a man and let me be upset, okay?

596
00:40:26,621 --> 00:40:28,154
There's more.

597
00:40:30,225 --> 00:40:32,992
Our contacts found out that
Romero was researching the FBI

598
00:40:33,028 --> 00:40:36,062
when he got killed.

599
00:40:36,097 --> 00:40:37,697
You know you're still inside me, right?

600
00:40:37,732 --> 00:40:41,034
You got to understand, Darlene.

601
00:40:41,069 --> 00:40:43,002
It doesn't look good.

602
00:40:43,038 --> 00:40:44,370
The FBI is involved.

603
00:40:44,406 --> 00:40:46,773
It's making the Dark Army nervous.

604
00:40:46,808 --> 00:40:48,408
They think somebody flipped.

605
00:40:48,443 --> 00:40:50,043
Okay, get it together, dude.

606
00:40:50,078 --> 00:40:52,679
No one fucking talked to the FBI.

607
00:40:52,714 --> 00:40:54,881
You can tell your pals
to eat a dick, okay?

608
00:40:54,916 --> 00:40:56,416
Now get off already.

609
00:40:56,451 --> 00:40:58,785
Don't be this stupid.

610
00:40:58,820 --> 00:41:00,853
They found your spot.

611
00:41:00,889 --> 00:41:02,121
The spot is fine.

612
00:41:02,157 --> 00:41:03,389
We did a full wipe-down.

613
00:41:03,425 --> 00:41:04,791
They won't find anything.

614
00:41:04,826 --> 00:41:07,293
Yeah, well, they have something,

615
00:41:07,328 --> 00:41:09,862
and Romero must have found out about it.

616
00:41:09,898 --> 00:41:11,931
He had a printout with a roster

617
00:41:11,966 --> 00:41:13,733
of FBI agents on something

618
00:41:13,768 --> 00:41:16,703
called Operation Berenstain.

619
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:21,207
And it looked top secret,

620
00:41:21,242 --> 00:41:23,409
possibly heavy surveillance.

621
00:41:30,485 --> 00:41:31,718
Shit.

622
00:41:35,657 --> 00:41:37,123
Okay, what? What?

623
00:41:37,158 --> 00:41:39,092
So that's it then?

624
00:41:39,127 --> 00:41:40,727
They know us? We're under surveillance?

625
00:41:40,762 --> 00:41:42,462
No, no, no. I'm not saying that.

626
00:41:45,967 --> 00:41:47,133
I got to leave the city.

627
00:41:47,168 --> 00:41:48,401
Wait, hold on.

628
00:41:48,436 --> 00:41:49,936
If you or anyone in your crew takes off,

629
00:41:49,971 --> 00:41:51,571
that's one way to ensure you get killed.

630
00:41:51,606 --> 00:41:53,106
That will make you look guilty,

631
00:41:53,141 --> 00:41:54,574
and we know the Dark
Army's blanket rule:

632
00:41:54,609 --> 00:41:56,843
they think the FBI's
even snooping around,

633
00:41:56,878 --> 00:41:58,111
and it gets ugly.

634
00:41:58,146 --> 00:42:01,414
So just stop being a hard-ass for once,

635
00:42:01,449 --> 00:42:03,983
and just let me help you.

636
00:42:11,693 --> 00:42:15,261
How the fuck did this happen?

637
00:42:15,296 --> 00:42:18,631
You seriously asking that?

638
00:42:18,666 --> 00:42:20,700
Do I need to remind you what you did?

639
00:42:26,639 --> 00:42:28,374
They called it the Good Samaritan Law

640
00:42:28,908 --> 00:42:30,007
on the account, like,

641
00:42:30,042 --> 00:42:31,342
you supposed to be helping people

642
00:42:31,377 --> 00:42:32,543
if they're in trouble.

643
00:42:32,578 --> 00:42:34,245
Like it was your duty and whatnot,

644
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:38,182
and if you didn't then you get arrested.

645
00:42:38,619 --> 00:42:41,987
But yo, not only did the
homies do jack shit,

646
00:42:42,023 --> 00:42:43,822
they also laughed at this fat dude

647
00:42:43,858 --> 00:42:45,357
while he was getting mugged,

648
00:42:45,393 --> 00:42:47,293
and I ain't gonna lie...
that was fucked up,

649
00:42:47,328 --> 00:42:49,528
but it was pretty funny, though.

650
00:42:57,181 --> 00:42:59,171
You staring at this thing.
You want to play?

651
00:43:02,410 --> 00:43:04,310
No.

652
00:43:04,345 --> 00:43:07,279
It's not for you.

653
00:43:07,315 --> 00:43:09,315
So who's it for then?

654
00:43:11,752 --> 00:43:14,820
Nobody.

655
00:43:14,855 --> 00:43:18,057
You know, back in the
Age of Enlightenment,

656
00:43:18,092 --> 00:43:19,692
motherfuckers used chess

657
00:43:19,727 --> 00:43:23,062
as a means of self-improvement,

658
00:43:23,097 --> 00:43:26,298
'cause there wasn't no Tony
Robbins DVDs back then.

659
00:43:26,334 --> 00:43:29,201
This was it.

660
00:43:29,236 --> 00:43:31,737
So what you playing for then?

661
00:43:31,772 --> 00:43:34,740
If there's no who, then what's the what?

662
00:43:34,775 --> 00:43:36,075
What's it for?

663
00:43:39,613 --> 00:43:41,046
Existence.

664
00:43:47,288 --> 00:43:48,754
Dope.

665
00:43:48,789 --> 00:43:51,857
Some high stakes right there.

666
00:43:51,892 --> 00:43:55,361
So what you waiting on?

667
00:43:55,396 --> 00:43:56,628
What?

668
00:43:59,533 --> 00:44:02,835
Do you dream, Elliot?

669
00:44:02,870 --> 00:44:04,536
You scraping so hard

670
00:44:04,572 --> 00:44:06,038
like you ain't ever asked
yourself this before.

671
00:44:06,073 --> 00:44:09,775
I said, do you want
to be here right now?

672
00:44:09,810 --> 00:44:11,410
And I don't mean, like, here-here,

673
00:44:11,445 --> 00:44:15,247
but I mean here in a cosmic sense, bro.

674
00:44:15,282 --> 00:44:19,418
Like, existence could be beautiful,

675
00:44:19,453 --> 00:44:24,256
or it could be ugly, but that's on you.

676
00:44:30,431 --> 00:44:34,299
How do I know which one's for me?

677
00:44:34,335 --> 00:44:36,869
Dream.

678
00:44:36,904 --> 00:44:40,906
You got to find out the
future you're fighting for.

679
00:44:40,941 --> 00:44:42,808
Sometimes you got to close your eyes

680
00:44:42,843 --> 00:44:46,945
and really envision that shit, bro.

681
00:44:46,981 --> 00:44:49,448
If you like it, then it's beautiful.

682
00:44:49,483 --> 00:44:51,917
If you don't?

683
00:44:51,952 --> 00:44:54,753
Then you might as well fade
the fuck out right now.

684
00:45:00,628 --> 00:45:02,795
You, me, in Madrid,

685
00:45:02,830 --> 00:45:05,898
walking down Calle Atocha,

686
00:45:05,933 --> 00:45:09,601
sitting in Café Rollerie
having a cortado.

687
00:45:09,637 --> 00:45:13,839
I have some friends who have
a vineyard on the coast.

688
00:45:13,874 --> 00:45:15,641
They would love you.

689
00:45:15,676 --> 00:45:17,676
Oh, during the harvest,
everyone goes there.

690
00:45:17,711 --> 00:45:21,513
It's beautiful that time of year.

691
00:45:23,350 --> 00:45:25,150
What's wrong?

692
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:29,488
Was it something I said?

693
00:45:29,523 --> 00:45:32,858
Madrid.

694
00:45:32,893 --> 00:45:35,994
Do you really think
you'll ever afford...

695
00:45:36,030 --> 00:45:39,798
you'll ever afford that?

696
00:45:39,834 --> 00:45:42,968
Well, maybe not now,

697
00:45:43,003 --> 00:45:45,137
but, like... hey,

698
00:45:45,172 --> 00:45:47,372
once I get my DJ career going, like,

699
00:45:47,408 --> 00:45:48,640
a lot of times

700
00:45:48,676 --> 00:45:52,878
they give you free trips.

701
00:45:52,913 --> 00:45:55,481
Like, for the jobs, and I...

702
00:45:55,516 --> 00:45:59,485
I can take you.

703
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:01,687
Derek, do you know why I'm with you?

704
00:46:07,728 --> 00:46:11,563
Why I'm dating you?

705
00:46:11,599 --> 00:46:14,133
You're a bartender.

706
00:46:14,168 --> 00:46:17,569
You make $15 an hour.

707
00:46:17,605 --> 00:46:21,974
You're never gonna be able
to take me to Madrid.

708
00:46:22,009 --> 00:46:24,910
You're never gonna be able to
afford to take me anywhere.

709
00:46:27,848 --> 00:46:31,350
You won't be able to give me
anything I want out of life.

710
00:46:35,389 --> 00:46:38,524
But I've had all those things before,

711
00:46:38,559 --> 00:46:42,427
and they never made me happy.

712
00:46:42,463 --> 00:46:46,532
That's why I love you.

713
00:46:46,567 --> 00:46:50,903
You're not any of that.

714
00:46:50,938 --> 00:46:53,972
And I don't need you to be
anything more than you are.

715
00:47:08,656 --> 00:47:11,523
If I do close my eyes,

716
00:47:11,559 --> 00:47:15,727
what is it that I
picture years from now?

717
00:47:15,763 --> 00:47:18,230
Like Leon said,

718
00:47:18,265 --> 00:47:20,766
doesn't one need to understand that

719
00:47:20,801 --> 00:47:24,403
before they're ready to
fight for their existence?

720
00:47:27,841 --> 00:47:31,076
How would my future fairy tale unfold?

721
00:47:38,252 --> 00:47:42,120
Will I finally connect with
those I deeply care for?

722
00:47:50,164 --> 00:47:53,498
Will I reunite with old
friends long gone?

723
00:47:59,840 --> 00:48:02,841
See the ones I love find true happiness?

724
00:48:19,326 --> 00:48:21,326
Maybe this future includes people

725
00:48:21,362 --> 00:48:24,529
I'd never dream of getting close to.

726
00:48:32,573 --> 00:48:36,375
Even make amends with those
I have unfairly wronged.

727
00:49:00,367 --> 00:49:03,068
A future that's not so lonely.

728
00:49:10,511 --> 00:49:13,412
A future filled with friends and family.

729
00:49:35,703 --> 00:49:37,402
You'd even be there.

730
00:49:56,924 --> 00:49:59,291
The world I've always wanted.

731
00:50:01,729 --> 00:50:04,963
And you know what?

732
00:50:04,998 --> 00:50:08,333
I would like very much to fight for it.

733
00:50:22,193 --> 00:50:26,029
In chess, help isn't allowed.

734
00:50:26,065 --> 00:50:29,433
That's the beauty of the game.

735
00:50:29,834 --> 00:50:31,601
You're locked into a set of moves

736
00:50:31,644 --> 00:50:34,645
as determined by your
previous choices...

737
00:50:38,967 --> 00:50:42,936
Your options dramatically
changing with every decision.

738
00:50:42,971 --> 00:50:45,438
There is no lifeline.

739
00:50:45,474 --> 00:50:48,575
There is no external force at play.

740
00:50:48,610 --> 00:50:52,312
It is a pure battle of two opponents,

741
00:50:52,347 --> 00:50:55,081
or in this case,

742
00:50:55,117 --> 00:50:56,750
one.

743
00:50:58,787 --> 00:51:00,353
Stalemate.

744
00:51:03,992 --> 00:51:05,458
Again.

745
00:51:05,494 --> 00:51:07,460
We need a winner. Let's reset.

746
00:51:15,137 --> 00:51:17,370
Remember when you first
taught me how to code?

747
00:51:18,407 --> 00:51:20,874
Not really.

748
00:51:20,909 --> 00:51:24,344
It was a computer chess game.

749
00:51:24,379 --> 00:51:26,646
You always told me you had
to know more moves ahead

750
00:51:26,682 --> 00:51:28,648
than the player or user.

751
00:51:28,684 --> 00:51:31,484
Sounds like good advice
from a good father.

752
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:33,853
Except for one thing.

753
00:51:33,889 --> 00:51:36,790
You're not my father.

754
00:51:36,825 --> 00:51:38,825
You're not even here right now.

755
00:51:46,368 --> 00:51:48,635
Another stalemate.

756
00:51:48,670 --> 00:51:51,972
What are the odds?

757
00:51:52,007 --> 00:51:53,406
Let's reset.

758
00:51:59,414 --> 00:52:02,015
Doesn't it make you sick
that while you're here,

759
00:52:02,050 --> 00:52:03,650
battling me, there are people out there,

760
00:52:03,685 --> 00:52:05,552
hurting everyone we care about?

761
00:52:05,587 --> 00:52:07,887
Everyone's hurting because of us.

762
00:52:07,923 --> 00:52:09,990
We are running around in circles.

763
00:52:10,025 --> 00:52:11,725
This will be the last
time that we do it.

764
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:14,194
Been thinking about
what you said earlier.

765
00:52:14,229 --> 00:52:15,595
You can think all the moves you want,

766
00:52:15,630 --> 00:52:17,697
but at the end of the day,

767
00:52:17,733 --> 00:52:19,199
the moves that I'm making are the ones

768
00:52:19,234 --> 00:52:21,101
you're telling me to make.

769
00:52:21,136 --> 00:52:22,902
He's right.

770
00:52:22,938 --> 00:52:25,605
There over 9 million
different possible positions

771
00:52:25,640 --> 00:52:27,540
after three chess moves each.

772
00:52:27,576 --> 00:52:31,111
There are over 288 billion
different possible positions

773
00:52:31,146 --> 00:52:32,445
after four moves.

774
00:52:32,481 --> 00:52:34,080
The number of 40-move games

775
00:52:34,116 --> 00:52:36,049
is greater than the number of electrons

776
00:52:36,084 --> 00:52:38,385
in the observable universe.

777
00:52:38,420 --> 00:52:40,954
You don't need to know those outcomes.

778
00:52:40,989 --> 00:52:44,224
You just need to be able to
see ahead of your opponent.

779
00:52:47,462 --> 00:52:50,563
But how can you when your
other opponent is...

780
00:52:53,168 --> 00:52:54,768
you?

781
00:52:58,073 --> 00:53:00,907
Stalemate.

782
00:53:00,942 --> 00:53:04,310
Three in a row.

783
00:53:04,346 --> 00:53:05,578
The odds of that are...

784
00:53:05,614 --> 00:53:07,147
Impossible.

785
00:53:08,917 --> 00:53:10,316
Go again?

786
00:53:16,925 --> 00:53:19,025
I can't beat you.

787
00:53:21,329 --> 00:53:23,863
And you can't beat me.

788
00:53:29,438 --> 00:53:32,672
We could play again, but...

789
00:53:32,707 --> 00:53:35,341
we will always be at this impasse.

790
00:53:41,516 --> 00:53:43,283
And you knew all along.

791
00:53:46,521 --> 00:53:48,955
It was the only way to
show you that fighting me

792
00:53:48,990 --> 00:53:52,959
is a waste of time.

793
00:53:52,994 --> 00:53:54,661
No.

794
00:53:54,696 --> 00:53:58,131
No, we'll go again. I can beat you.

795
00:53:58,166 --> 00:54:00,500
I can beat you.

796
00:54:02,504 --> 00:54:06,439
When will you finally realize
that I'm here for a reason?

797
00:54:09,678 --> 00:54:11,678
This is avoidance!

798
00:54:11,713 --> 00:54:14,347
Our fight for that future that you want

799
00:54:14,382 --> 00:54:15,882
isn't with me at chess!

800
00:54:15,917 --> 00:54:18,318
It's what you do out there with them.

801
00:54:20,489 --> 00:54:24,057
I want to be here, Elliot.

802
00:54:24,092 --> 00:54:25,725
With you.

803
00:54:41,576 --> 00:54:45,745
I want an office on the 20th floor.

804
00:54:45,780 --> 00:54:48,915
I want Melissa's job, and
it's non-negotiable.

805
00:54:58,360 --> 00:55:00,393
Go on.

806
00:55:00,428 --> 00:55:03,429
I saw the pattern.

807
00:55:03,465 --> 00:55:05,431
In every version of the settlement draft

808
00:55:05,467 --> 00:55:07,901
for the Washington Township suit,

809
00:55:07,936 --> 00:55:11,738
there was one small point that
your team wouldn't agree on.

810
00:55:11,773 --> 00:55:16,042
It remained the same, even
from the original case:

811
00:55:16,077 --> 00:55:19,846
That a third-party company
must perform inspections

812
00:55:19,881 --> 00:55:22,849
on the Washington Township plant.

813
00:55:22,884 --> 00:55:26,019
You continue to give up power
on all these other provisions

814
00:55:26,054 --> 00:55:29,622
that appear to be a lot more
expensive and important,

815
00:55:29,658 --> 00:55:33,593
all in an attempt to drop
this one small point.

816
00:55:34,963 --> 00:55:36,796
I know why you had those guys arrested

817
00:55:36,831 --> 00:55:39,132
and why you gave me this job.

818
00:55:39,167 --> 00:55:41,301
You want me to convince the class

819
00:55:41,336 --> 00:55:43,536
to remove the contingency,

820
00:55:43,572 --> 00:55:45,405
and I'm willing to do all of that,

821
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:48,808
because you're gonna give me

822
00:55:48,843 --> 00:55:50,476
exactly what I want in return.

823
00:55:59,120 --> 00:56:01,688
Those are my terms.

824
00:56:07,262 --> 00:56:10,263
I must say,

825
00:56:10,298 --> 00:56:13,132
you are very impressive.

826
00:56:17,806 --> 00:56:21,975
But I'm sorry, my dear.

827
00:56:22,010 --> 00:56:26,512
This is all in your head.

828
00:56:26,548 --> 00:56:28,815
Now, don't take that as a slight.

829
00:56:32,287 --> 00:56:34,687
Always good to have dreams.

830
00:56:38,326 --> 00:56:39,792
Wait.

831
00:56:45,834 --> 00:56:47,333
I'm not wrong.

832
00:56:52,207 --> 00:56:54,040
Go home.

833
00:57:15,330 --> 00:57:17,063
Fuck.

834
00:57:20,702 --> 00:57:22,402
Do you remember the first command

835
00:57:22,437 --> 00:57:26,372
you ever taught me, and my
computer kept crashing?

836
00:57:26,408 --> 00:57:28,141
It was init 1.

837
00:57:28,176 --> 00:57:30,543
That became our thing, and I
am telling you right now,

838
00:57:30,578 --> 00:57:32,011
I am fucking crashing, man,

839
00:57:32,047 --> 00:57:35,348
and so are you, and I need your help.

840
00:57:35,383 --> 00:57:37,917
I need you to get on the
same channel we used to.

841
00:57:37,952 --> 00:57:41,154
I wouldn't ask you this if
it wasn't life or death.

842
00:57:41,189 --> 00:57:43,423
Okay? We're in trouble
this time, Elliot.

843
00:57:43,458 --> 00:57:44,458
All of us.

844
00:57:44,459 --> 00:57:46,059
I have no access here.

845
00:57:46,094 --> 00:57:47,760
It's not as if I'm gonna
go back to my place.

846
00:57:47,796 --> 00:57:49,028
Well, it needs to happen ASAP,

847
00:57:49,064 --> 00:57:51,164
so figure something out.

848
00:57:51,199 --> 00:57:53,366
We might be owned.

849
00:57:53,401 --> 00:57:55,001
What?

850
00:57:55,036 --> 00:57:56,369
Why?

851
00:57:56,404 --> 00:57:58,404
Well, I don't know, but we need to.

852
00:58:04,045 --> 00:58:05,945
Elliot?

853
00:58:05,980 --> 00:58:07,814
God, Elliot, say something.

854
00:58:14,055 --> 00:58:15,988
Did you mean what you said?

855
00:58:18,993 --> 00:58:22,762
That you wanted him, not me?

856
00:58:26,968 --> 00:58:30,403
Did you mean it, Darlene?

857
00:58:30,438 --> 00:58:34,073
I need to know.

858
00:58:34,109 --> 00:58:36,142
I want you.

859
00:58:36,177 --> 00:58:38,077
Only you.

860
00:58:44,652 --> 00:58:47,754
Don't worry.

861
00:58:47,789 --> 00:58:49,322
I know what to do.

862
00:58:51,926 --> 00:58:53,126
Why are we back here?

863
00:58:53,161 --> 00:58:54,627
You cannot do this.

864
00:58:54,662 --> 00:58:56,062
You cannot confess.

865
00:58:56,097 --> 00:58:57,296
This won't save her.

866
00:58:57,332 --> 00:58:58,664
They're gonna destroy her.

867
00:59:06,541 --> 00:59:08,040
Who won?

868
00:59:10,845 --> 00:59:12,478
No one.

869
00:59:31,533 --> 00:59:34,367
What else can I do you for?

870
00:59:34,402 --> 00:59:37,136
You tell him anything, and it's suicide.

871
00:59:37,172 --> 00:59:40,339
I am pleading with you, Elliot,
just walk away from this, now.

872
00:59:40,375 --> 00:59:42,442
I'm here to...

873
00:59:42,477 --> 00:59:45,144
to help you with that computer problem

874
00:59:45,180 --> 00:59:47,747
you've been having.

875
00:59:55,356 --> 00:59:58,391
I would ask what made
you change your mind,

876
00:59:58,426 --> 01:00:01,527
but I'ma quit while I'm ahead.

877
01:00:01,563 --> 01:00:03,663
Hey.

878
01:00:03,698 --> 01:00:05,898
Yeah, get in here.

879
01:00:15,844 --> 01:00:20,046
Did you know...

880
01:00:20,081 --> 01:00:23,850
that Moses heard voices too?

881
01:00:26,187 --> 01:00:28,654
Abraham,

882
01:00:28,690 --> 01:00:30,690
John,

883
01:00:30,725 --> 01:00:32,692
Paul,

884
01:00:32,727 --> 01:00:35,595
Jesus.

885
01:00:35,630 --> 01:00:40,032
In fact, many prophets
confessed to hearing voices.

886
01:00:40,068 --> 01:00:42,602
People like you...

887
01:00:42,637 --> 01:00:46,672
what you have...

888
01:00:46,708 --> 01:00:50,610
it can be divinity,
Elliot, if you let it.

889
01:01:23,111 --> 01:01:25,578
This is what the last IT
guys told me I needed to do.

890
01:01:29,083 --> 01:01:33,286
This looks like it's just
a simple site migration.

891
01:01:33,321 --> 01:01:35,388
As long as one of us understands.

892
01:01:38,493 --> 01:01:39,759
I got this.

893
01:01:48,303 --> 01:01:50,836
Elliot, before you get started,

894
01:01:50,872 --> 01:01:55,074
something you should know.

895
01:01:55,109 --> 01:01:59,812
My online business is
very important to me.

896
01:01:59,847 --> 01:02:03,115
I'm like you. I'm a private guy.

897
01:02:03,151 --> 01:02:04,684
I prefer discretion.

898
01:02:08,156 --> 01:02:10,957
So I'm asking you to help me

899
01:02:10,992 --> 01:02:13,192
with the task at hand

900
01:02:13,227 --> 01:02:15,494
and not to look where you don't need to.

901
01:02:26,874 --> 01:02:29,875
Why is he here?

902
01:02:29,911 --> 01:02:31,444
You need help,

903
01:02:31,479 --> 01:02:33,045
something goes wrong...

904
01:02:33,081 --> 01:02:35,281
Lone Star will be here.

905
01:02:35,316 --> 01:02:38,217
He's got my number and can get
in touch with me right away.

906
01:02:47,595 --> 01:02:50,396
Thank you again.

907
01:02:58,439 --> 01:03:01,073
I know.

908
01:03:01,109 --> 01:03:02,975
I know.

909
01:03:03,011 --> 01:03:07,079
This is really scratching
that part of my brain again,

910
01:03:07,115 --> 01:03:10,616
but that's the part of my brain
I need to start ignoring.

911
01:03:33,441 --> 01:03:35,141
What's Darlene saying?

912
01:03:41,649 --> 01:03:45,785
The FBI.

913
01:03:45,820 --> 01:03:49,855
They found the arcade.

914
01:03:49,891 --> 01:03:52,825
There might be a surveillance program.

915
01:03:58,099 --> 01:03:59,965
Romero's dead.

916
01:04:08,443 --> 01:04:10,242
What do you think?

917
01:04:10,278 --> 01:04:12,378
Is Ray right?

918
01:04:12,413 --> 01:04:14,880
Should I listen to the voice?

919
01:04:14,916 --> 01:04:17,650
Does it make me special?

920
01:04:17,685 --> 01:04:21,487
Like Moses?

921
01:04:21,522 --> 01:04:23,923
I don't have many options.

922
01:04:23,958 --> 01:04:26,125
My sister's in trouble.

923
01:04:26,160 --> 01:04:30,062
Someone's closing in on us,
and at least for her sake,

924
01:04:30,098 --> 01:04:33,966
I have to find out what they know.

925
01:04:34,001 --> 01:04:37,770
Maybe this is how I fight
for that future I want.

926
01:04:42,343 --> 01:04:44,310
What exactly are you doing?

927
01:04:46,280 --> 01:04:48,047
I'm hacking the FBI.

928
01:04:50,465 --> 01:04:53,551
