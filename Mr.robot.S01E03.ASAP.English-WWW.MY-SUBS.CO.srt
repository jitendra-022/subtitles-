1
00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:01,994
I will be the youngest executive

2
00:00:01,995 --> 00:00:03,696
this company has ever seen.

3
00:00:03,697 --> 00:00:05,264
<i>All right, you know, I'll
take it if you leave us alone.</i>

4
00:00:05,265 --> 00:00:06,265
<i>- Thank you.
- All right?</i>

5
00:00:06,266 --> 00:00:07,333
<i>Check track two out.</i>

6
00:00:07,334 --> 00:00:09,001
<i>- Well, track two.
- All right, man.</i>

7
00:00:10,804 --> 00:00:12,805
<i>Why didn't you tell
me about the DAT file?</i>

8
00:00:12,806 --> 00:00:14,974
Worked at Evil Corp his whole life,

9
00:00:14,975 --> 00:00:16,275
and out of the blue he got fired.

10
00:00:16,276 --> 00:00:18,511
No one knew why. He had leukemia.

11
00:00:18,512 --> 00:00:20,446
Made me swear to never tell anyone.

12
00:00:20,447 --> 00:00:22,948
Finally, I got so worried, told my mom.

13
00:00:22,949 --> 00:00:24,684
When he found out, he got pissed.

14
00:00:24,685 --> 00:00:25,918
You ever think you deserved it?

15
00:00:25,919 --> 00:00:28,321
I was eight years old...

16
00:00:28,322 --> 00:00:30,890
You didn't commit to the
sacred pact you'd formed.

17
00:00:46,173 --> 00:00:48,207
<i>My approach
within our business units</i>

18
00:00:48,208 --> 00:00:50,643
<i>is to first invest in new technologies</i>

19
00:00:50,644 --> 00:00:52,945
<i>and develop prototypes
in order to understand</i>

20
00:00:52,946 --> 00:00:54,180
<i>the technology potential,</i>

21
00:00:54,181 --> 00:00:56,449
<i>because despite the recent success</i>

22
00:00:56,450 --> 00:00:58,384
<i>of our cyber security team,</i>

23
00:00:58,385 --> 00:01:00,886
<i>our company currently still has</i>

24
00:01:00,887 --> 00:01:03,823
<i>72 potential hacker vulnerabilities</i>

25
00:01:03,824 --> 00:01:05,891
<i>in our primary and secon... oh, wait.</i>

26
00:01:05,892 --> 00:01:08,861
<i>It's 73, you stupid piece of shit.</i>

27
00:01:08,862 --> 00:01:10,129
Again.

28
00:01:10,130 --> 00:01:12,164
<i>Our company currently still has</i>

29
00:01:12,165 --> 00:01:15,067

30
00:01:15,068 --> 00:01:17,837
<i>in our primary and
secondary data centers.</i>

31
00:01:17,838 --> 00:01:20,039
<i>Now is not the time to be encumbered</i>

32
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:22,675
<i>by the company's
tragic and shameful loss</i>

33
00:01:22,676 --> 00:01:24,410
of our chief te...

34
00:01:24,411 --> 00:01:26,178
<i>Too formal, God damn it.</i>

35
00:01:26,179 --> 00:01:27,913
Warm it up. Don't be a cold robot.

36
00:01:27,914 --> 00:01:29,181
Again.

37
00:01:29,182 --> 00:01:31,584
Now is not the time to be encumbered

38
00:01:31,585 --> 00:01:34,086
by the company's
tragic and shameful loss

39
00:01:34,087 --> 00:01:36,055
of our chief technology officer.

40
00:01:36,056 --> 00:01:39,358
We have to be swift in
naming the replacement CTO,

41
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:43,129
and, sir, I would like
to suggest it be me.

42
00:01:47,534 --> 00:01:49,235
For the sake of our company,

43
00:01:49,236 --> 00:01:52,271
that we make our decision today,

44
00:01:52,272 --> 00:01:54,306
my promotion...

45
00:01:56,710 --> 00:02:00,379
My internal promotion shows
not only our confidence

46
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:04,784
as a company, but strength
in our boldness to the public.

47
00:02:04,785 --> 00:02:08,587
Thank you for your time.

48
00:02:08,588 --> 00:02:11,757
You will be the next
CTO of this company.

49
00:02:11,758 --> 00:02:15,094
You will be the next
CTO of this company.

50
00:02:15,095 --> 00:02:19,064
You will be the next
CTO of this company.

51
00:02:19,065 --> 00:02:20,199
Sure you don't want anything?

52
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:22,234
Pellegrino, tea?

53
00:02:28,775 --> 00:02:31,777
Sir, thank you again for seeing me.

54
00:02:31,778 --> 00:02:34,980
Tyrell, I'm gonna have
to reschedule this.

55
00:02:34,981 --> 00:02:36,982
- Anwar, set up another time.
- Sir, it's just that I think...

56
00:02:36,983 --> 00:02:38,617
I get it, I get it.

57
00:02:38,618 --> 00:02:40,653
We'll get another meeting
on the books right away.

58
00:02:40,654 --> 00:02:44,390
We've got a really good CTO candidate

59
00:02:44,391 --> 00:02:47,126
the board is very excited about.

60
00:02:47,127 --> 00:02:50,162
They're not ready to discuss it yet.

61
00:02:50,163 --> 00:02:51,564
We'll loop you in.

62
00:02:51,565 --> 00:02:53,999
Just give us a couple of weeks, hmm?

63
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,668
Uh, put Wellick back on the books.

64
00:02:55,669 --> 00:02:57,269
Two weeks.

65
00:02:57,270 --> 00:02:59,071
Oh, nice tie.

66
00:02:59,072 --> 00:03:00,773
Let me guess.

67
00:03:00,774 --> 00:03:02,775
Brioni?

68
00:03:02,776 --> 00:03:04,343
Great taste, as always.

69
00:03:04,344 --> 00:03:06,545
Be well.

70
00:03:08,215 --> 00:03:10,616
I'll email your assistant the details.

71
00:03:14,488 --> 00:03:16,689
If you could,

72
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:18,457
just email it to me directly.

73
00:03:18,458 --> 00:03:21,026
This is too important for me to miss.

74
00:03:44,651 --> 00:03:48,454
Mr. Wellick, we're here.

75
00:03:59,332 --> 00:04:02,401
You think I could have 300 this time?

76
00:04:04,504 --> 00:04:06,572
Spoken like a true capitalist.

77
00:04:29,763 --> 00:04:32,064
Bad day at the office?

78
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:40,940
No ki...

79
00:04:59,726 --> 00:05:03,515
Please, enough. No more.

00:06:58,771 --> 00:07:00,772
I don't know.

00:07:03,075 --> 00:07:05,844
What are you doing here?

104
00:07:05,845 --> 00:07:08,246
We talked maybe a few hours ago

You don't remember?

107
00:07:11,217 --> 00:07:14,452
They said I was your emergency contact.

108
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:19,057
Um, right.

109
00:07:19,058 --> 00:07:21,927
Um, you told them to
call your psychiatrist.

110
00:07:21,928 --> 00:07:24,529
You can't leave until you talk to one.

111
00:07:24,530 --> 00:07:26,565
So I'm gonna wait outside.

112
00:07:27,934 --> 00:07:29,701
Hey.

113
00:07:34,707 --> 00:07:37,042
Do you remember requesting
me from the staff?

114
00:07:41,714 --> 00:07:43,682
You requested me because
the police said that...

115
00:07:43,683 --> 00:07:46,785
I got jumped by a bunch of kids.

116
00:07:46,786 --> 00:07:49,721
It's not the end of the world.

117
00:07:49,722 --> 00:07:52,724
They wanted to do a full
drug panel, and you refused.

118
00:07:52,725 --> 00:07:54,759
May I ask why?

119
00:07:57,630 --> 00:08:00,465
Elliot, if we can't have
a conversation about this...

120
00:08:02,602 --> 00:08:04,603
I've been taking morphine.

121
00:08:08,908 --> 00:08:10,508
Why?

122
00:08:12,511 --> 00:08:16,781
I don't have a good
enough reason to give you.

123
00:08:16,782 --> 00:08:19,618
I wish I did, but I don't.

124
00:08:22,421 --> 00:08:24,389
Maybe we should consider rehab.

125
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:25,724
I'm not a junkie.

126
00:08:25,725 --> 00:08:27,225
Then you'll need to prove it to me.

127
00:08:27,226 --> 00:08:29,794
Submit to a bimonthly
drug test voluntarily.

128
00:08:29,795 --> 00:08:32,464

<i>He uses useless virus
scans, dated servers,</i>

143

<i>and security software
that runs on Windows 98.</i>

144

00:10:03,589 --> 00:10:07,492
<i>I was the mistake that
led to all of this.</i>

161
00:10:07,493 --> 00:10:09,160
I have to ask you one thing.

162
00:10:09,161 --> 00:10:13,732
Did you have something to
do with Vera getting busted?

163
00:10:13,733 --> 00:10:15,500
Shit, Elliot.

164
00:10:15,501 --> 00:10:18,236
You said you weren't gonna do anything.

165
00:10:18,237 --> 00:10:20,372
He's on murder charges,
do you know that?

166
00:10:20,373 --> 00:10:22,240
His whole crew bounced.

167
00:10:22,241 --> 00:10:24,943
I mean, I don't know what
I'm gonna do for money now.

168
00:10:24,944 --> 00:10:27,512
Just tell me, Elliot,

169
00:10:27,513 --> 00:10:29,414
and don't lie.

170
00:10:29,415 --> 00:10:31,349
Did you do something?

171
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:33,385
No.

172
00:10:36,622 --> 00:10:38,456
Hmm.

173
00:10:38,457 --> 00:10:40,625
Hey.

174
00:10:40,626 --> 00:10:43,628
Hey.

175
00:10:43,629 --> 00:10:46,097
Are you okay?

176
00:10:46,098 --> 00:10:47,866
I mean, with everything that happened...

177
00:10:47,867 --> 00:10:51,369
I'm fine.

178
00:10:51,370 --> 00:10:53,471
What happened to your door?

179
00:10:56,776 --> 00:10:58,410
You're not supposed to be here, okay?

180
00:10:58,411 --> 00:10:59,911
I changed the locks for a reason.

181
00:10:59,912 --> 00:11:02,447
Mmm.

182
00:11:02,448 --> 00:11:04,716
Interesting toy,

183
00:11:04,717 --> 00:11:06,785
but you may want to spend
a little more scratch

184
00:11:06,786 --> 00:11:09,053
if you actually want it to, you know,

185
00:11:09,054 --> 00:11:11,122
work.

186
00:11:11,123 --> 00:11:12,657
Check it.

187
00:11:12,658 --> 00:11:15,927
Jessica Alba says she
wants to join Fsociety.

188
00:11:17,830 --> 00:11:20,098
Jesus, what happened to your face?

189
00:11:20,099 --> 00:11:22,133
What's going on?

190
00:11:25,471 --> 00:11:28,406
Well, I am not the
princess of social graces,

191
00:11:28,407 --> 00:11:30,175
but typically it goes something like,

192
00:11:30,176 --> 00:11:33,178
- "Hi, this is Darlene".
- Stop.

193
00:11:33,179 --> 00:11:35,680
You need to leave.

194
00:11:35,681 --> 00:11:38,249
Babe, seriously, we have
a lot of shit to discuss,

195
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:39,284
so if you wouldn't mind...

196
00:11:39,285 --> 00:11:40,852
Get out.

197
00:11:52,364 --> 00:11:54,365
I suggest you get a grip.

198
00:11:58,637 --> 00:12:01,506
What was she talking about?

199
00:12:01,507 --> 00:12:03,107
I got to get to work.

200
00:12:03,108 --> 00:12:05,009
Work? Are you serious?

201
00:12:05,010 --> 00:12:07,445
You can't go to work.
You have to call in sick.

202
00:12:07,446 --> 00:12:11,115
I have to go.

203
00:12:11,116 --> 00:12:14,819
<i>A bug is never just a mistake.</i>

204
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:17,422
<i>It represents something bigger.</i>

205
00:12:23,496 --> 00:12:25,530
<i>An error of thinking.</i>

206
00:12:25,531 --> 00:12:28,199
<i>- Sir! Sir! Sir!
- That makes you who you are.</i>

207
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:32,036
<i>Sir! You dropped your wallet.</i>

208
00:12:32,037 --> 00:12:34,873
- Thanks.
- Stop!

209
00:12:34,874 --> 00:12:36,541
<i>Stop! He stole my purse.</i>

210
00:12:36,542 --> 00:12:37,976
That was your wallet?

211
00:12:37,977 --> 00:12:41,012
Yes, that was my wallet
you just gave him.

212
00:12:41,013 --> 00:12:44,415
Stop!

213
00:12:44,416 --> 00:12:45,984
He got into my
system, and he wants me

214
00:12:45,985 --> 00:12:47,685
to put the CD on one of
the computers at work.

215
00:12:47,686 --> 00:12:51,356
<i>- Why does he want to do that?
- I don't know, Stella.</i>

216
00:12:51,357 --> 00:12:52,724
He didn't give me a full explanation.

217
00:12:52,725 --> 00:12:54,425
<i>So he's got naked pics of me?</i>

218
00:12:54,426 --> 00:12:55,760
Is that the only thing
you're seriously taking away

219
00:12:55,761 --> 00:12:56,761
from this conversation?

220
00:12:59,398 --> 00:13:01,032
Hey, babe.

221
00:13:01,033 --> 00:13:03,568
- Hey.
- How was your run?

222
00:13:03,569 --> 00:13:04,903
Strange.

223
00:13:04,904 --> 00:13:06,571
Someone dropped their wallet,

224
00:13:06,572 --> 00:13:09,707
and I picked it up to give
it to them, but then this...

225
00:13:09,708 --> 00:13:11,175
Nothing strange about
that... just shows how good

226
00:13:11,176 --> 00:13:12,410
of a person you are.

227
00:13:12,411 --> 00:13:13,845
Always have been.

228
00:13:13,846 --> 00:13:17,715
Almost to a fault.

229
00:13:17,716 --> 00:13:19,183
What does that mean?

230
00:13:19,184 --> 00:13:23,021
Just that you...

231
00:13:23,022 --> 00:13:27,025
you're too good for the world.

232
00:13:27,026 --> 00:13:31,796
That's probably why I love you.

233
00:13:31,797 --> 00:13:35,266
I'm gonna hop in the shower.

234
00:13:37,770 --> 00:13:39,437
I told you I can't talk.

235
00:13:39,438 --> 00:13:42,040
You
have 100 hours precisely.

236
00:13:42,041 --> 00:13:47,045
After that, everything
we own will be released.

237
00:14:01,158 --> 00:14:04,051
____

238
00:14:16,038 --> 00:14:17,372
It's not enough, just to focus
your attention on the logs.

239
00:14:17,373 --> 00:14:19,341
We should also monitor
social media traffic

240
00:14:19,342 --> 00:14:21,176
as well as IRC, Pastebin.

241
00:14:21,177 --> 00:14:23,878
And set up scripts to keep going 24/7.

242
00:14:23,879 --> 00:14:25,714
I mean, we might get lucky.

243
00:14:25,715 --> 00:14:28,350
They might get sloppy,
make a mistake, you know...

244
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:30,518
<i>This is the world we live in.</i>

245
00:14:30,519 --> 00:14:32,987
<i>People relying on each other's mistakes</i>

246
00:14:32,988 --> 00:14:36,424
<i>to manipulate one another
and use one another,</i>

247
00:14:36,425 --> 00:14:38,560
<i>even relate to one another.</i>

248
00:14:38,561 --> 00:14:41,096
<i>A warm, messy circle of humanity.</i>

249
00:14:41,097 --> 00:14:43,498
Elliot.

250
00:14:43,499 --> 00:14:46,101
I'm inviting you guys to dinner tonight.

251
00:14:46,102 --> 00:14:48,937
Morton's notwithstanding,
I cook a mean steak.

252
00:14:53,642 --> 00:14:56,544
What? Can't a boss invite his
favorite employees to dinner?

253
00:14:56,545 --> 00:15:00,081
No, that's cool, but I got plans.

254
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:06,588
Can you guys give us a minute?

255
00:15:08,391 --> 00:15:09,391
Yeah.

256
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:15,964
You want to tell me what's going on?

257
00:15:15,965 --> 00:15:17,699
- Not really.
- Oh.

258
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:19,401
You're missing work, you
come in looking like that,

259
00:15:19,402 --> 00:15:22,470
and you expect me not to ask questions?

260
00:15:22,471 --> 00:15:24,272
Look, I don't know how
much you want me asking

261
00:15:24,273 --> 00:15:25,707
about your personal life, but...

262
00:15:25,708 --> 00:15:27,575
Not at all, actually.

263
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:32,147
I mean, I don't mean to be rude.

264
00:15:32,148 --> 00:15:35,583
I was... I'm just being honest.

265
00:15:41,323 --> 00:15:43,591
<i>Mr. Robot may
have found Evil Corp's bug,</i>

266
00:15:43,592 --> 00:15:45,927
<i>but he didn't find mine.</i>

267
00:15:45,928 --> 00:15:48,997
<i>That's the only way to protect myself.</i>

268
00:15:48,998 --> 00:15:51,065
<i>Never show them my source code.</i>

269
00:15:51,066 --> 00:15:53,001
<i>Close myself off.</i>

270
00:15:53,002 --> 00:15:54,803
<i>Create my cold, perfect maze</i>

271
00:15:54,804 --> 00:15:58,339
<i>where no one can ever find me.</i>

272
00:15:58,340 --> 00:16:00,275
Elliot, I cannot believe you work here.

273
00:16:00,276 --> 00:16:02,477
This place is a shithole.

274
00:16:02,478 --> 00:16:05,079
Look, I thought I'd swing by,
take you to lunch.

275
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:09,017
Oh, that's nice.

276
00:16:09,018 --> 00:16:11,152
I think she likes you, bud.

277
00:16:11,153 --> 00:16:12,854
All right, fine, I'll take her,

278
00:16:12,855 --> 00:16:15,156
but let the record show I was
trying to be a good wingman.

279
00:16:15,157 --> 00:16:17,592
Oh, calm down. Shit.

280
00:16:17,593 --> 00:16:19,294
I'm not that into redheads anyway.

281
00:16:19,295 --> 00:16:22,130
The whole nation of
Ireland makes my dick soft.

282
00:16:22,131 --> 00:16:23,164
Leave.

283
00:16:23,165 --> 00:16:24,365
Darlene said we need to talk.

284
00:16:24,366 --> 00:16:26,034
Leave now.

285
00:16:26,035 --> 00:16:27,335
You're right. Probably
shouldn't talk here.

286
00:16:27,336 --> 00:16:28,870
Let's go to that bar next door.

287
00:16:28,871 --> 00:16:30,338
I'm not going anywhere with you.

288
00:16:30,339 --> 00:16:32,273
I'm not going anywhere until you do,

289
00:16:32,274 --> 00:16:34,509
so I can hang out here
and create a scene,

290
00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:36,177
or you can give me five
minutes at the bar next door.

291
00:16:36,178 --> 00:16:37,679
Either way, I'm gonna have fun.

292
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,714
Dealer's choice.

293
00:16:44,019 --> 00:16:46,354
Mmm.

294
00:16:46,355 --> 00:16:49,491
What? It's an Appletini.

295
00:16:49,492 --> 00:16:52,126
I should kick your ass.

296
00:16:52,127 --> 00:16:53,795
Mmm.

297
00:16:53,796 --> 00:16:55,697
If that'll make us square,
you have my blessing.

298
00:16:55,698 --> 00:16:57,799
Nah, man, I want nothing to do with you.

299
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:58,833
You're a maniac.

300
00:17:01,303 --> 00:17:02,637
What can I get for you?

301
00:17:02,638 --> 00:17:04,339
Uh, nothing.

302
00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:05,840
You should probably order something.

303
00:17:05,841 --> 00:17:09,143
- I'd recommend this...
- Fine.

304
00:17:09,144 --> 00:17:14,816
I'll... I'll have an Appletini.

305
00:17:14,817 --> 00:17:16,084
You should take it as a compliment, guy.

306
00:17:16,085 --> 00:17:18,253
These things are goddamn delicious.

307
00:17:20,723 --> 00:17:22,056
I get it.

308
00:17:22,057 --> 00:17:23,491
Compliments make me uncomfortable too.

309
00:17:23,492 --> 00:17:25,560
I find that hard to believe.

310
00:17:25,561 --> 00:17:29,998
Yeah, who am I kidding?
I love compliments.

311
00:17:29,999 --> 00:17:32,033
$12.

312
00:17:49,718 --> 00:17:51,019
I really don't think you enjoyed that.

313
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:54,088
- I suggest sipping...
- Last chance.

314
00:17:54,089 --> 00:17:56,124
What do you want?

315
00:17:59,762 --> 00:18:01,896
I'm sorry for what I did.

316
00:18:01,897 --> 00:18:03,598
I don't buy it.

317
00:18:03,599 --> 00:18:06,234
More importantly, I don't give a shit.

318
00:18:06,235 --> 00:18:09,304
I never wanted to hurt you.

319
00:18:09,305 --> 00:18:10,805
People who get violent get that way

320
00:18:10,806 --> 00:18:15,476
because they can't communicate.

321
00:18:15,477 --> 00:18:18,813
Your dad,

322
00:18:18,814 --> 00:18:21,950
I bet he felt shitty
for doing what he did.

323
00:18:21,951 --> 00:18:25,920
I'm sure he wanted to apologize too.

324
00:18:25,921 --> 00:18:28,723
Sometimes pushing your
kid away is just easier.

325
00:18:28,724 --> 00:18:30,959
Don't stay mad at him too long, kiddo.

326
00:18:33,796 --> 00:18:35,663
You're leaving?

327
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:39,834
That's what you want, isn't it?

328
00:18:46,775 --> 00:18:50,011
What about your plan?

329
00:18:50,012 --> 00:18:51,646
Plan?

330
00:18:51,647 --> 00:18:53,648
You're the key to the whole thing.

331
00:18:53,649 --> 00:18:56,918
Without you, there is no plan.

332
00:18:56,919 --> 00:18:59,454
That's it?

333
00:18:59,455 --> 00:19:01,356
It's over?

334
00:19:01,357 --> 00:19:03,391
Expect me to believe that?

335
00:19:07,296 --> 00:19:09,297
See you in another life.

336
00:19:18,474 --> 00:19:20,475
<i>Did you hear that?</i>

337
00:19:20,476 --> 00:19:22,210
<i>I can't believe it.</i>

338
00:19:22,211 --> 00:19:24,278
<i>Is it really happening?</i>

339
00:19:24,279 --> 00:19:26,948
<i>Fsociety finally over.</i>

340
00:19:26,949 --> 00:19:29,450
<i>The recent glitch in the
otherwise neat reality</i>

341
00:19:29,451 --> 00:19:31,452
<i>I created over the years.</i>

342
00:19:31,453 --> 00:19:33,621
<i>I'll never slip up like that again.</i>

343
00:19:33,622 --> 00:19:35,957
<i>I'm gonna be more normal now.</i>

344
00:19:35,958 --> 00:19:38,640
<i>Maybe Shayla could
even be my girlfriend.</i>

345
00:19:38,641 --> 00:19:43,224
<i>I'll go see those stupid Marvel movies
with her. I'll join a gym.</i>

346
00:19:44,667 --> 00:19:47,135
<i>I'll heart things on Instagram.</i>

347
00:19:47,136 --> 00:19:49,737
<i>I'll drink vanilla lattes.</i>

348
00:19:49,738 --> 00:19:52,373
<i>I'm gonna lead a
bug-free life from now on.</i>

349
00:19:52,374 --> 00:19:54,976
<i>Anything to protect my perfect maze.</i>

350
00:20:01,583 --> 00:20:04,686
Hey, Gideon.

351
00:20:04,687 --> 00:20:07,555
Is that dinner still on for tonight?

352
00:20:07,556 --> 00:20:09,590
Um, yeah. Sure.

353
00:20:09,591 --> 00:20:12,427
Uh, you want to come?

354
00:20:12,428 --> 00:20:13,761
Yeah.

355
00:20:15,531 --> 00:20:16,731
Great.

356
00:20:19,702 --> 00:20:21,536
Can I bring my girlfriend?

357
00:20:22,571 --> 00:20:24,372
You have a girlfriend?

358
00:20:25,708 --> 00:20:28,276
Well, I, uh, haven't asked her yet,

359
00:20:28,277 --> 00:20:30,511
but I will.

360
00:20:30,512 --> 00:20:33,047
Hopefully she'll say yes.

361
00:20:34,383 --> 00:20:36,384
Uh, yeah. Sure.

362
00:20:36,385 --> 00:20:39,620
Perfect.

363
00:20:39,621 --> 00:20:40,621
Thanks.

364
00:20:51,633 --> 00:20:52,934
Was he drinking Starbucks?

365
00:21:08,697 --> 00:21:11,098
Are you still trying to rip that CD?

366
00:21:11,099 --> 00:21:13,534
Yeah, it's all... it's all scratched up.

367
00:21:15,003 --> 00:21:17,037
Let's get out of here.

368
00:21:38,033 --> 00:21:39,111

___

378
00:22:26,775 --> 00:22:28,976
My boss invited me to a dinner party

379
00:22:28,977 --> 00:22:31,912
at his place tonight.

380
00:22:31,913 --> 00:22:34,448
I thought you could
come as my girlfriend.

381
00:22:34,449 --> 00:22:36,150
What?

382
00:22:36,151 --> 00:22:40,120
Are you actually asking me to
be your girlfriend right now?

383
00:22:40,121 --> 00:22:42,489
Yeah.

384
00:22:42,490 --> 00:22:43,924
Anyway, I need you.

385
00:22:43,925 --> 00:22:48,162
I'm not good in social
situations like that.

386
00:22:48,163 --> 00:22:52,433
There is something
seriously wrong with you.

387
00:22:52,434 --> 00:22:54,635
I'm not gonna be used anymore.

388
00:22:54,636 --> 00:22:56,837
Why don't you ask the girl
from this morning, okay?

389
00:22:56,838 --> 00:22:58,639
She seems like she might
want to go to some stupid,

390
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:01,442
stuffy dinner party.

391
00:23:01,443 --> 00:23:03,777
You don't actually know me.

392
00:23:03,778 --> 00:23:05,312
All you know is that I'm the girl...

393
00:23:05,313 --> 00:23:07,514
<i>Of course I know Shayla.</i>

394
00:23:07,515 --> 00:23:10,784
<i>I hacked her email as soon
as she moved in next door.</i>

395
00:23:10,785 --> 00:23:12,052
<i>With a simple phishing scam,</i>

396
00:23:12,053 --> 00:23:13,721
<i>I owned her password pretty easily.</i>

397
00:23:13,722 --> 00:23:15,656
I'm not talking about the
stuff you can find online.

398
00:23:15,657 --> 00:23:19,960
I'm talking about the real me.

399
00:23:19,961 --> 00:23:22,830
Tell me, then.

400
00:23:22,831 --> 00:23:25,733
No. Forget it.

401
00:23:25,734 --> 00:23:27,768
I want to know.

402
00:23:51,359 --> 00:23:53,360
<i>What is this?</i>

403
00:23:55,296 --> 00:23:56,563
I just put all the elements...

404
00:23:56,564 --> 00:23:58,666
<i>- It's beautiful.
- Together.</i>

405
00:23:58,667 --> 00:24:00,100
<i>I've never seen this before.</i>

406
00:24:00,101 --> 00:24:02,202
<i>- She must...
- Never posted online.</i>

407
00:24:02,203 --> 00:24:03,671
Um, I mean, a lot of them's not...

408
00:24:03,672 --> 00:24:05,739
they're not done.

409
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:07,941
<i>She's got her
own private maze too.</i>

410
00:24:07,942 --> 00:24:09,777
Took a lot of different pieces,

411
00:24:09,778 --> 00:24:11,845
um, from different things,

412
00:24:11,846 --> 00:24:16,684
like from my photographs
or drawings and...

413
00:24:16,685 --> 00:24:19,119
Like, there's this one.

414
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:22,923
Um, it's really f... ing corny,

415
00:24:22,924 --> 00:24:26,093
but, like, it has everything...
the kids and the...

416
00:24:26,094 --> 00:24:28,729
<i>Shayla's bug
was always elusive to me.</i>

417
00:24:28,730 --> 00:24:30,364
<i>Maybe this was it.</i>

418
00:24:30,365 --> 00:24:33,701
<i>Wanting normalcy but
stuck in the outer fringes,</i>

419
00:24:33,702 --> 00:24:36,103
<i>not knowing how to participate.</i>

420
00:24:36,104 --> 00:24:38,138
<i>Just like me.</i>

421
00:24:41,142 --> 00:24:43,143
Can I kiss you?

422
00:24:52,353 --> 00:24:55,222
Next time, don't ask.

423
00:24:55,223 --> 00:24:58,092
It's lame.

424
00:24:58,093 --> 00:25:00,661
<i>Bugs usually get a bad rap.</i>

425
00:25:00,662 --> 00:25:02,463
<i>But sometimes...</i>

426
00:25:02,464 --> 00:25:04,565
Don't let me down, okay?

427
00:25:04,566 --> 00:25:08,235
<i>When a bug
finally makes itself known,</i>

428
00:25:08,236 --> 00:25:11,505
<i>it can be exhilarating,</i>

429
00:25:11,506 --> 00:25:15,943
<i>like you just unlocked something.</i>

430
00:25:15,944 --> 00:25:17,778
A grand opportunity

431
00:25:17,779 --> 00:25:19,980
<i>waiting to be taken advantage of.</i>

432
00:25:28,123 --> 00:25:30,758
Mr. Wellick?

433
00:25:30,759 --> 00:25:32,926
Hey.

434
00:25:32,927 --> 00:25:34,328
What was your name again?

435
00:25:34,329 --> 00:25:36,363
Anwar.

436
00:25:36,364 --> 00:25:38,465
I didn't know you came
to places like this.

437
00:25:38,466 --> 00:25:39,967
I don't.

438
00:25:39,968 --> 00:25:43,771
What do you mean? You're here now.

439
00:25:43,772 --> 00:25:46,340
I'm here because you are.

440
00:25:46,341 --> 00:25:49,643
What? Sorry, I don't get it.

441
00:25:49,644 --> 00:25:53,981
I think you're beautiful.
I want to take you home.

442
00:25:53,982 --> 00:25:57,951
Wait, I thought you were married.

443
00:25:57,952 --> 00:26:00,854
<i>Because, after all,
a bug's only purpose,</i>

444
00:26:00,855 --> 00:26:03,490
<i>its only reason for existence</i>

445
00:26:03,491 --> 00:26:06,660
<i>is to be a mistake that needs fixing,</i>

446
00:26:06,661 --> 00:26:09,329
<i>to help you right a wrong.</i>

447
00:26:09,330 --> 00:26:11,532
<i>And what feels better than that?</i>

448
00:26:20,199 --> 00:26:23,001
So, Elliot,

449
00:26:23,002 --> 00:26:25,670
do you think you should introduce us?

450
00:26:25,671 --> 00:26:30,775
Oh, um, Shayla, this
is Angela and Ollie.

451
00:26:32,578 --> 00:26:35,947
You, uh, you look lovely this evening.

452
00:26:39,952 --> 00:26:41,252
What up, guys?

453
00:26:41,253 --> 00:26:42,887
You just get here?

454
00:26:42,888 --> 00:26:44,122
Nice suit.

455
00:26:44,123 --> 00:26:46,157
Thanks, dude.

456
00:26:50,896 --> 00:26:54,098
- Shit.
- What is up with you?

457
00:26:54,099 --> 00:26:55,533
You've been fidgeting all night.

458
00:26:55,534 --> 00:26:57,402
Maybe we should try the doorbell again.

459
00:27:04,910 --> 00:27:06,978
Hey, guys.

460
00:27:06,979 --> 00:27:08,613
How long have you
been standing out here?

461
00:27:08,614 --> 00:27:10,648
The doorbell is broken.
I should have warned you.

462
00:27:10,649 --> 00:27:12,584
Come in. I'm Harry, by the way.

463
00:27:12,585 --> 00:27:14,819
- Angela. Nice to meet you.
- Good to meet you.

464
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:16,154
- Always nice to put a face...
- Hey.

465
00:27:16,155 --> 00:27:19,057
With an employee badge number, right?

466
00:27:19,058 --> 00:27:21,626
Ollie, how long have
you guys been together?

467
00:27:21,627 --> 00:27:24,495
- 2 and a half years.
- 2 years.

468
00:27:24,496 --> 00:27:27,231
Okay.

469
00:27:27,232 --> 00:27:30,735
Elliot, how long have you
and Shayla been together?

470
00:27:30,736 --> 00:27:35,006
Well, uh, um,

471
00:27:35,007 --> 00:27:37,342
J... just today.

472
00:27:45,818 --> 00:27:48,586
Okay, enough grilling of the guests.

473
00:27:48,587 --> 00:27:50,355
Let's check on the real grill, shall we?

474
00:27:50,356 --> 00:27:54,525
Elliot, I could use your help.

475
00:27:54,526 --> 00:27:56,427
So I have a confession.

476
00:27:56,428 --> 00:27:59,497
I had the sys admins at
the data center in Dulles

477
00:27:59,498 --> 00:28:02,000
check that server again.

478
00:28:02,001 --> 00:28:04,135
<i>Gideon, what did you do?</i>

479
00:28:04,136 --> 00:28:06,671
Of course there was nothing.

480
00:28:06,672 --> 00:28:08,973
I have no idea what there was
to even be suspicious about.

481
00:28:08,974 --> 00:28:12,110
I mean, what possible
motivation would you have

482
00:28:12,111 --> 00:28:13,678
to do anything? I guess
I was just being...

483
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:15,513
<i>Gideon has to let this go.</i>

484
00:28:15,514 --> 00:28:17,115
<i>If he comes near this hornet's nest,</i>

485
00:28:17,116 --> 00:28:19,183
<i>I'm not sure I can save him from it.</i>

486
00:28:19,184 --> 00:28:21,219
<i>I have to kill any suspicion left.</i>

487
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:24,555
You've been nothing but
a hard worker for Allsafe,

488
00:28:24,556 --> 00:28:28,826
so I apologize.

489
00:28:32,031 --> 00:28:34,232
After the conversation on the plane,

490
00:28:34,233 --> 00:28:37,535
I knew what was at
stake... the whole company.

491
00:28:37,536 --> 00:28:39,837
I was worried that the DAT file I found

492
00:28:39,838 --> 00:28:40,872
wasn't the right one.

493
00:28:40,873 --> 00:28:42,473
I just didn't

494
00:28:42,474 --> 00:28:45,243
want to get your hopes
up in case I was wrong.

495
00:28:47,413 --> 00:28:50,915
That's why I didn't tell
you before the meeting.

496
00:28:58,123 --> 00:28:59,757
<i>Shit.</i>

497
00:28:59,758 --> 00:29:02,260
<i>I'm gonna have to let
him hug me, aren't I?</i>

498
00:29:09,268 --> 00:29:12,036
You're such a brilliant
engineer, Elliot,

499
00:29:12,037 --> 00:29:13,871
and you should never doubt your skills

500
00:29:13,872 --> 00:29:16,107
no matter how much
pressure I put on you.

501
00:29:16,108 --> 00:29:19,077
And you certainly don't have
to keep anything from me.

502
00:29:19,078 --> 00:29:21,112
I care about you.

503
00:29:38,430 --> 00:29:41,532
<i>From the Mixed-up Files
of Basil E. Frankweiler.</i>

504
00:29:41,533 --> 00:29:43,634
That's where I got the idea, remember?

505
00:29:46,004 --> 00:29:50,808
I wanted to be Claudia Kincaid so bad.

506
00:29:50,809 --> 00:29:52,844
Even her name was cool.

507
00:29:56,682 --> 00:30:02,086
Remember we thought we
were going to The Met,

508
00:30:02,087 --> 00:30:07,925
somehow we ended up at
The Queens Museum instead?

509
00:30:07,926 --> 00:30:10,461
No Google Maps back then.

510
00:30:12,931 --> 00:30:15,133
I loved running away with you.

511
00:30:19,338 --> 00:30:20,838
Somehow when you're eight,

512
00:30:20,839 --> 00:30:23,674
running away can be fun.

513
00:30:25,444 --> 00:30:26,978
<i>The normal life.</i>

514
00:30:26,979 --> 00:30:30,348
<i>Smiles, dinner parties,</i>

515
00:30:30,349 --> 00:30:32,250
<i>childhood stories.</i>

516
00:30:32,251 --> 00:30:34,185
<i>I could get used to this,</i>

517
00:30:34,186 --> 00:30:36,220
<i>maybe even like it.</i>

518
00:30:50,636 --> 00:30:52,236
What's wrong?

519
00:30:56,809 --> 00:30:58,709
Corp's
hacking scandal continues

520
00:30:58,710 --> 00:31:00,478
with the release of these latest emails.

521
00:31:00,479 --> 00:31:03,648
Information stemming from
the latest dump reveals

522
00:31:03,649 --> 00:31:06,684
that Terry Colby was one of
three high-level executives

523
00:31:06,685 --> 00:31:08,152
involved in the cover-up

524
00:31:08,153 --> 00:31:09,821
of the widely publicized

525
00:31:09,822 --> 00:31:12,356
Washington Township toxic waste scandal.

526
00:31:12,357 --> 00:31:13,724
If these reports are true,

527
00:31:13,725 --> 00:31:15,893
Colby may be facing more indictments.

528
00:31:15,894 --> 00:31:17,628
In the ensuing 24 months

529
00:31:17,629 --> 00:31:20,998
after the alleged toxic
waste leak in 1993,

530
00:31:20,999 --> 00:31:25,169
26 employees died from
similar types of leukemia.

531
00:31:25,170 --> 00:31:28,372
Evil Corp, however, managed
to get the class-action lawsuit

532
00:31:28,373 --> 00:31:31,676
filed against it by the
surviving victims dismissed,

533
00:31:31,677 --> 00:31:34,245
claiming there was no
direct evidence linking

534
00:31:34,246 --> 00:31:36,414
their factories to the diagnoses.

535
00:31:36,415 --> 00:31:40,017
Now these emails indicate
that Colby was in fact aware

536
00:31:40,018 --> 00:31:42,153
of the dangerous levels of toxicity

537
00:31:42,154 --> 00:31:44,522
and kept it a secret as it

538
00:31:44,523 --> 00:31:47,692
"would not be cost-effective
to retool the current systems

539
00:31:47,693 --> 00:31:52,163
in place even if there
are potential lawsuits".

540
00:31:52,164 --> 00:31:54,565
Mr. Colby was unavailable
for comment, but his lawyer...

541
00:31:54,566 --> 00:31:56,901
<i>My perfect maze</i>

542
00:31:56,902 --> 00:31:58,903
<i>crumbling before my eyes.</i>

543
00:31:58,904 --> 00:32:01,873
Data dump are
further proof Colby was set up,

544
00:32:01,874 --> 00:32:03,407
but they didn't indicate by whom.

545
00:32:03,408 --> 00:32:05,509
<i>There's nothing to hide behind.</i>

546
00:32:05,510 --> 00:32:08,112
<i>I didn't think it
existed, but there it was.</i>

547
00:32:08,113 --> 00:32:10,781
<i>Is.</i>

548
00:32:10,782 --> 00:32:13,684
<i>Mr. Robot finally found my bug.</i>

549
00:32:13,685 --> 00:32:16,220
Linking the waste
levels in Washington Township

550
00:32:16,221 --> 00:32:18,089
to the victims' illnesses.

551
00:32:18,090 --> 00:32:20,024
Legal analysts support the claim

552
00:32:20,025 --> 00:32:21,092
that there is not enough evidence...

553
00:32:21,093 --> 00:32:22,927
What's going on?

554
00:32:22,928 --> 00:32:26,564
That's how my mom,
um, and Elliot's dad...

555
00:32:26,565 --> 00:32:28,299
- I have to go.
- Wait, wait.

556
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:30,067
- Let me come with you.
- No, I'd rather you didn't.

557
00:32:30,068 --> 00:32:31,636
Evidence in the Washington
Township scandal.

558
00:32:31,637 --> 00:32:34,605
Terry Colby remains under investigation

559
00:32:34,606 --> 00:32:36,240
for his alleged involvement with the...

560
00:32:37,579 --> 00:32:40,014
Dismissed
because there was no evidence

561
00:32:40,015 --> 00:32:41,849
linking the waste levels
in Washington Township...

562
00:32:41,850 --> 00:32:43,484
Evil Corp...

563
00:32:43,485 --> 00:32:46,087
Don't look so sad.

564
00:32:46,088 --> 00:32:47,722
He did this to himself.

565
00:32:47,723 --> 00:32:50,324
He gave in. He was a coward.

566
00:32:50,325 --> 00:32:53,528
He was weak and pathetic.

567
00:32:53,529 --> 00:32:56,230
And in the end, that's
what killed your father.

568
00:32:59,201 --> 00:33:01,703
Why are you crying?

569
00:33:01,704 --> 00:33:03,838
Don't ask so many questions.

570
00:33:03,839 --> 00:33:05,373
I miss him.

571
00:33:05,374 --> 00:33:06,941
There's no point to that.

572
00:33:06,942 --> 00:33:09,711
But I do.

573
00:33:09,712 --> 00:33:12,113
Then you're just as weak as him.

574
00:33:12,114 --> 00:33:14,515
You're not sad?

575
00:33:14,516 --> 00:33:17,585
Why should I be?

576
00:33:17,586 --> 00:33:20,555
It's a beautiful night.

577
00:33:20,556 --> 00:33:22,557
The weather is nice,

578
00:33:22,558 --> 00:33:24,592
and I'm enjoying my cigarette.

579
00:33:30,132 --> 00:33:32,700
<i>The bug forces

580
00:33:32,701 --> 00:33:35,903
<i>evolve into something new because of it.</i>

581
00:33:35,904 --> 00:33:38,206
<i>Work around it or work through it.</i>

582

583
00:33:42,444 --> 00:33:45,279

584
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:47,715
<i>The next version.</i>

00:33:47,716 --> 00:33:51,385
<i>The inevitable upgrade.</i>

586
00:34:31,126 --> 00:34:34,095
You're a strange creature.

587
00:34:34,096 --> 00:34:36,697
I'm just a businessman.

588
00:34:41,804 --> 00:34:44,639
And that's about as
clean as I'm gonna get it.

589
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:46,974
You have to do the rest in the shower.

590
00:34:46,975 --> 00:34:49,277
I don't mind being a little dirty.

591
00:34:49,278 --> 00:34:51,312
I do.

592
00:36:10,893 --> 00:36:12,793
You should join me.

593
00:36:12,794 --> 00:36:14,629
Yeah, I'll be there in a minute.

594
00:36:26,508 --> 00:36:28,509
Hey.

595
00:36:33,015 --> 00:36:35,917
I'm sorry that I ran off like that.

596
00:36:35,918 --> 00:36:37,551
Did you talk to him?

597
00:36:37,552 --> 00:36:38,953
Nope. He wasn't home.

598
00:36:38,954 --> 00:36:41,389
Well, I'm here.

599
00:36:41,390 --> 00:36:43,555
I want to talk to you about everything,

600
00:36:43,556 --> 00:36:44,988
just not tonight, okay?

601
00:36:44,989 --> 00:36:48,006
So you talked to him,
but not with you boyfriend?

602
00:36:48,007 --> 00:36:49,179
It's different, Ollie.

603
00:36:49,180 --> 00:36:53,350
Both of our parents died because...

604
00:36:53,351 --> 00:36:57,287
That's how we know each other.

605
00:36:57,288 --> 00:37:00,591
I really don't want to
talk about this right now.

606
00:37:00,592 --> 00:37:03,393
What if I do?

607
00:37:03,394 --> 00:37:05,262
What if you do what?

608
00:37:05,263 --> 00:37:09,133
Want to talk.

609
00:37:09,134 --> 00:37:12,102
About...

610
00:37:12,103 --> 00:37:14,138
something.

611
00:37:17,442 --> 00:37:22,212
What the hell are you talking about?

612
00:37:22,213 --> 00:37:25,048
I have to tell you something.

613
00:37:25,049 --> 00:37:28,051
I don't know why you're
putting yourself through this.

614
00:37:28,052 --> 00:37:31,121
You don't have to keep looking at it.

615
00:37:31,122 --> 00:37:33,457
All right? It meant nothing.

616
00:37:36,127 --> 00:37:37,661
Okay, I know I sound
like a broken record,

617
00:37:37,662 --> 00:37:39,496
but I love you, and
I want to be with you.

618
00:37:39,497 --> 00:37:41,532
Stop speaking.

619
00:37:44,936 --> 00:37:47,504
Just tell me what you need

620
00:37:47,505 --> 00:37:49,940
in order for me to fix
this, and I'll do it.

621
00:37:55,780 --> 00:37:58,782
We need to break up.

622
00:37:58,783 --> 00:38:00,250
Angela, come on.

623
00:38:00,251 --> 00:38:02,286
What choice did you give me, Ollie?

624
00:38:02,287 --> 00:38:04,121
Look, I know I have a problem.

625
00:38:04,122 --> 00:38:05,122
I'm not denying that.

626
00:38:05,123 --> 00:38:06,623
Well, maybe my problem is

627
00:38:06,624 --> 00:38:09,960
I can't be with a guy with your problem.

628
00:38:11,362 --> 00:38:13,964
Where's the CD?

629
00:38:13,965 --> 00:38:16,667
It's in my... in my bag. Why?

630
00:38:16,668 --> 00:38:18,702
He has my bank account, Ollie.

631
00:38:18,703 --> 00:38:22,139
- And my dad's bank account.
- How did they...

632
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:24,208
Our accounts are linked
because of my student loans.

633
00:38:24,209 --> 00:38:26,176
I used your laptop to access it.

634
00:38:26,177 --> 00:38:28,045
He has my dad's social security,

635
00:38:28,046 --> 00:38:30,981
his credit card numbers, everything.

636
00:38:30,982 --> 00:38:32,115
Okay.

637
00:38:32,116 --> 00:38:33,650
Okay, that is bad,

638
00:38:33,651 --> 00:38:35,619
but I'm sure the cops
will figure out a way...

639
00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:37,321
If we don't do what this guy says

640
00:38:37,322 --> 00:38:39,122
and we go to the cops,
then he's just going to sell

641
00:38:39,123 --> 00:38:40,490
our information to the highest bidder,

642
00:38:40,491 --> 00:38:43,193
and me and my dad are
completely screwed.

643
00:38:43,194 --> 00:38:45,529
Do you have any idea how difficult it is

644
00:38:45,530 --> 00:38:49,032
to come back from massive
identity theft like this?

645
00:38:49,033 --> 00:38:51,355
What are you saying?

646
00:38:57,275 --> 00:38:59,010
Angela, are you crazy?

647
00:38:59,011 --> 00:39:02,313
No, we cannot just
infect Allsafe's network

648
00:39:02,314 --> 00:39:03,648
because of this.

649
00:39:03,649 --> 00:39:06,250
I'll lose my job.

650
00:39:06,251 --> 00:39:08,285
And there it is.

651
00:39:15,794 --> 00:39:17,762
You'll lose your job too,

652
00:39:17,763 --> 00:39:21,532
if that matters.

653
00:39:21,533 --> 00:39:24,835
Besides, even if we put the CD in,

654
00:39:24,836 --> 00:39:26,937
who says this guy won't
just do all this anyway?

655
00:39:39,017 --> 00:39:40,518
Hey.

656
00:39:40,519 --> 00:39:43,254
Hey, hey, come here.

657
00:39:43,255 --> 00:39:46,757
Look at me.

658
00:39:46,758 --> 00:39:51,062
We are going to figure this out.

659
00:39:51,063 --> 00:39:53,097
Okay?

660
00:39:56,101 --> 00:39:59,103
You're right. You're right.

661
00:39:59,104 --> 00:40:00,571
I'm sorry.

662
00:40:00,572 --> 00:40:03,474
I'm just scared.

663
00:40:03,475 --> 00:40:04,975
I don't want to break up with you.

664
00:40:04,976 --> 00:40:08,245
I'm sorry that I said that.

665
00:40:09,981 --> 00:40:11,782
Oh.

666
00:40:14,119 --> 00:40:15,853
I love you so much.

667
00:40:44,452 --> 00:40:45,986
<i>This is admin, Dulles.</i>

668
00:40:45,987 --> 00:40:49,289
Yeah, hi, this is Gideon
Goddard at Allsafe Security.

669
00:40:49,290 --> 00:40:53,360
I need to talk to Sean Skyler
about server CS30 again.

670
00:40:53,361 --> 00:40:54,761
<i>Hold please. I'll transfer you.</i>
