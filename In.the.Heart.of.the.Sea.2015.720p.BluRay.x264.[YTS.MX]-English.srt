"Or do the stories exist only to make us
respect the sea's dark secrets?

"The question both vexes and excites me

We received your letter.

You're either a desperate man or a fool
to come all the way to Nantucket.

Well, my offer still stands.

Three months' lodgings
for a single night's talk.

35

All I have in the world.

36
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,961
But I prefer to think of it
as an investment.

37
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:49,841
I want you to tell me
what happened to the Essex.

38
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,081
(SIGHS) What do you think happened?

39
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:02,650
There are rumblings.
Rumors that the Essex was...

What do you want?

41
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:06,008
What story do you expect to hear?

42
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,605
That of the whale.

43
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:13,326
The Essex ran aground.
There was a full inquiry.

44
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:16,286
I believe the inquiry
was less than truthful.

45
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,167
Get out.

46
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:23,845
You are the last survivor
of the Essex, sir.

To anyone. Never has. Never.

55

There's an agony about him.

56
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:55,804
His soul is in torment,

57
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:58,201
and in need of confession.

58

Please, just let me talk to him.

00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:17,048
I believe it would do you good
to talk to the man.

00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,281
No.

63

You listen well.

Who holds this place together
while you drink yourself to death?

65
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:34,882
You will talk with this man as much
as is necessary to keep the money.

66
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:38,807
You know our circumstances, Thomas.

67
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:52,123
Only as much as is necessary.

I'll get whiskey.

MELVILLE: I neglected to mention it
in my letter, but I was a whaler once.

70
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:12,808
One trip, I mean.

71
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:14,641
Green hand.

72
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,848
So, you've seen it all.

73
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,804
My wife read your books.

74
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,969
She enjoyed them.

75
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,284
I'm happy to hear it.

76
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,048
I've had good sales.

77
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:32,210
And I think this story
could surpass the success

78
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,806
of even my first novel,
which did quite well.

80

Have you read Hawthorne, Mr. Melville?

81
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,409
Now there's a writer.

82
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:50,010
Great writer.

83
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,366
He is.

84
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:56,690
But he is not here. And I am.

85
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,125
For my own particular reasons.

86
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,809
I will tell you of the Essex.

87
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,564
I believe you will be disappointed.

88
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,646
But every word I say will be true.

- Owen. You don't wanna be late.

I'll be there.

94
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,724
Besides, can't have our daughter
sleeping under a leaky roof, can we?

95
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:40,082
What makes you so sure it's a girl?

96
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,126
Well, it has to be.

97
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:45,563
So she can remind me why I still
love you when you're being stubborn.

98
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:48,691
Well, if it's to be a daughter,
she'll be a version of you, not me.

Blond locks and determined
to conquer the world.

100

I suppose after today, you'll be
trading in that tunic for a uniform.

101
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,406
That's right.

102
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,925
Finally out of this patch of dirt,
into a captain's house like you deserve.

103
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:03,609
PEGGY: I don't need one of those houses
in town with stuffy neighbors.

104
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,171
There's plenty of room here
for the three of us.

105
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:10,488
You know, sometimes your kind heart
and good nature is just unbearable.

106
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,328
Go get your captaincy.

Mmm-hmm.

Mr. Mason, you promised me
command of a ship after my last voyage

when I brought you back 1,500 barrels.

You can have all the voyages

Yes, well, blood is not gonna fill

To successfully command,
a captain needs respect.

Now, what if the men don't respect him?

00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,646
And if you bring back
2,000 barrels of oil,

164
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,768
I give you my word,

165
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:35,325
next time, you will have your captaincy.

166
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:38,211
You've given me
your word before, Mr. Mason.

167
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,283
No, this time, I'll take it in writing.

168
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,127
(DOOR CLOSES)

169
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,529
Captain Pollard.

170
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,483
We've just had a most
agreeable conversation with Mr. Chase.

171
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:04,166
He'll be honored to serve under you.

172
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,844
I'm glad to hear it.

173
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,523
Now I'm to babysit a greenhorn.

174
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:13,921
Some chinless Nantucketer born
with a damn silver spoon in his mouth.

175
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:16,208
You know, I should've thrown
the offer back in their faces.

176
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:19,807
Why? You now have
the offer of command in writing.

177
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:23,765
Yes, well, a liar's word is worthless,
even on paper.

178
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:35,971
You know, I'd love you just as much
if you were a merchant captain.

179
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:38,603
And you wouldn't be gone for two years.

180
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:40,000
I won't be gone two years.

181
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:43,842
A Bedford whaler came back
last week who was gone three.

182
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,480
She lost two men
and still with her hull half empty.

183
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:49,206
Yeah, well, they were from Bedford,
and they didn't have me on board.

184
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:55,930
Son of a bitch!

185
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,364
I will captain my own ship!

186
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,730
A whaling ship.

187
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,881
Up to them, all we'd ever have
is this patch of dirt,

188
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,405
and that's not gonna happen, Peggy.

189
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:10,364
Those are your father's words, not yours.

190
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:12,524
What's wrong with his words?

191
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:15,324
He wanted things
for his family, for himself.

192
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:17,841
He was a dreamer, Owen.

193
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,889
Yes, he was.

194
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:23,325
Dreamed of the sea and never got
to sail it because of men like them.

195
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,489
At least he got to see his children born.

196
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:36,010
It's all I know.

197
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,290
I'm sorry.

198
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,365
I married a whaleman.

199
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:53,926
Hey.

200
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:58,451
I'll come back as quick
as a summer's night, I swear.

201
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,885
Just come back.

202
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,286
Promise me.

203
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:18,450
I already swore to you.
Now you want me to promise, too?

204
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,605
I promise.

205
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,849
POLLARD SR.: Son, a word with you.

206
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,171
To be a captain, you cannot be a friend.

207
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:47,486
You are their superior.

208
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:51,601
Never forget that.
Never let them forget that.

209
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:52,966
Thank you, sir.

210
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:57,006
Your great-grandfather and a few others
created this industry.

211
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:01,566
Without us, without you,
the world plunges into darkness.

We were one of the last ships to go out,

which is why my friend
Barzillai and I got a berth.

Scared, but more scared to show it.

That's right. He did.

to circumnavigate
the planet bestowed to us.

1123
01:22:54,040 --> 01:22:55,769
To bend nature to our will.

1124
01:22:56,320 --> 01:23:00,325
You really feel like an earthly king
after everything that we've been through?

1125
01:23:01,280 --> 01:23:03,089
We're nothing. We're...

We're specks. And dust.

We sail into the sun at dawn.

If we are to die,
then with God's grace, let us die as men.

we closed the body

1193

01:37:53,120 --> 01:37:54,451
May God have mercy.

1285
01:38:37,480 --> 01:38:38,686
(WEAKLY) Mr. Chase.

1286
01:38:41,240 --> 01:38:43,049
(WEAKLY) Father!

1287
01:38:44,880 --> 01:38:47,167
(WHIMPERING) Don't leave me, Father!

1288
01:38:51,680 --> 01:38:54,729
(SEAGULL SQUAWKING)

1289
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:39,445
Mr. Chase.

1290
01:39:40,880 --> 01:39:42,405
Mr. Chase.

1291
01:39:42,560 --> 01:39:44,881
Sir, look. Look, sir.

1292
01:39:48,560 --> 01:39:51,404
Mr. Chase, look.

1293
01:39:52,840 --> 01:39:54,569
Wake up, Mr. Chase!

1294
01:39:55,400 --> 01:39:56,606
Here, wake up!

1295
01:39:58,200 --> 01:40:00,362
Please wake up, sir, there's land.

1296
01:40:01,240 --> 01:40:02,844
Mr. Chase, look.

1297
01:40:23,160 --> 01:40:27,681
NICKERSON: We were rescued there,
off the island of Más Afuera, Chile,

1298
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:31,571
90 days after the sinking of the Essex.

1299
01:40:33,440 --> 01:40:35,283
They gave us some old clothes.

1300
01:40:35,440 --> 01:40:36,851
Fed us, too.

1301
01:40:38,480 --> 01:40:40,403
It was hard to eat at first.

1302
01:40:40,560 --> 01:40:41,800
Strange.

1303
01:40:43,480 --> 01:40:45,403
They looked after us as best they could

1304
01:40:45,600 --> 01:40:47,841
till we found a ship
that would carry us home.

1305
01:40:49,400 --> 01:40:51,243
That voyage took another three months.

1306
01:41:00,920 --> 01:41:04,003
It looked like the whole island
turned out to see us return.

1307
01:41:05,400 --> 01:41:07,129
But there were no cheers.

1308
01:41:08,240 --> 01:41:09,446
Only silence.

1309
01:41:11,120 --> 01:41:14,363
They looked at us like
we were apparitions,

1310
01:41:15,400 --> 01:41:16,731
phantoms.

1311
01:41:17,920 --> 01:41:22,005
We'd said nothing of the details
of our survival to anyone,

1312
01:41:22,160 --> 01:41:25,209
but I wondered if they somehow
knew of our privations.

1313
01:41:27,040 --> 01:41:28,690
Maybe they were just curious.

1314
01:42:08,200 --> 01:42:09,725
Oh, my God!

1315
01:42:14,120 --> 01:42:15,360
(SOBBING)

1316
01:42:17,120 --> 01:42:18,531
I promised, didn't I?

1317
01:42:26,680 --> 01:42:27,886
Oh, God.

1318
01:42:29,680 --> 01:42:30,727
Hi.

1319
01:42:32,160 --> 01:42:33,844
Hey, sweetie. Who's this?

1320
01:42:35,320 --> 01:42:36,446
Phoebe Ann.

1321
01:42:36,840 --> 01:42:38,171
(PEGGY LAUGHING)

1322
01:42:40,920 --> 01:42:42,570
Phoebe Ann Chase, huh?

1323
01:42:43,960 --> 01:42:45,325
This is Daddy.

1324
01:42:47,320 --> 01:42:48,560
Hey, sweetie.

1325
01:42:53,920 --> 01:42:55,365
PEGGY: It's your daddy.

1326
01:43:03,360 --> 01:43:04,646
Oh, my God.

1327
01:43:12,720 --> 01:43:14,449
NICKERSON:
Of course, they couldn't leave him alone.

1328
01:43:15,280 --> 01:43:18,329
Mr. Chase and his wife had
scarcely walked a block towards home

1329
01:43:18,480 --> 01:43:21,768
when he was stopped and
made to return to the Maritime office.

1330
01:43:23,240 --> 01:43:26,050
There were business matters
still in question.

1331
01:43:39,800 --> 01:43:41,245
So, to the matter.

1332
01:43:45,960 --> 01:43:49,362
Due to the significant loss of life
and property on our voyage,

1333
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:51,843
it seems there will be an inquiry.

1334
01:43:52,800 --> 01:43:56,208
And as captain and first mate,
we will be expected to give an account

1335
01:43:56,360 --> 01:43:57,646
of what happened.

1336
01:43:57,800 --> 01:43:59,086
Yes, of course.

1337
01:43:59,240 --> 01:44:03,643
And having discussed this
with the ship owners and my father,

1338
01:44:04,840 --> 01:44:08,526
it is clear that full disclosure
will have ramifications.

1339
01:44:09,120 --> 01:44:11,487
Terrible ramifications
for the whole industry.

1340
01:44:12,920 --> 01:44:15,161
That a whale brought down the Essex.

1341
01:44:16,600 --> 01:44:17,806
But it's the truth.

1342
01:44:25,960 --> 01:44:27,962
If the insurance houses and investors

1343
01:44:28,120 --> 01:44:32,967
were to start worrying
about sea monsters sinking ships,

1344
01:44:33,160 --> 01:44:35,367
sailors drawing lots to survive...

1345
01:44:37,120 --> 01:44:38,690
We are in the oil business.

1346
01:44:39,440 --> 01:44:40,646
All of us.

1347
01:44:41,360 --> 01:44:42,486
And as in any business,

1348
01:44:42,640 --> 01:44:46,201
the probability of success must
always be greater than the risk incurred.

1349
01:44:48,760 --> 01:44:50,808
So, what are you suggesting, George?

1350
01:44:51,160 --> 01:44:53,049
That you say the ship ran aground.

1351
01:44:54,120 --> 01:44:55,201
That's a lie.

1352
01:44:55,440 --> 01:44:58,569
- And that the men that died, drowned.
- And that's another lie.

1353
01:44:58,840 --> 01:45:00,126
Think on it. They will make you captain.

1354
01:45:00,280 --> 01:45:02,408
Well, that pledge I already have
in writing.

1355
01:45:02,560 --> 01:45:06,042
Only on the condition
you bring home a ship full of oil.

1356
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:09,286
This way, it's guaranteed.

1357
01:45:09,560 --> 01:45:11,449
FULLER: You would be a wealthy man.

1358
01:45:12,280 --> 01:45:14,965
The name Chase need
no longer be a landsman's name,

1359
01:45:15,360 --> 01:45:16,407
but an established name

1360
01:45:16,560 --> 01:45:19,291
that belongs among the great families
of Nantucket.

1361
01:45:20,720 --> 01:45:22,961
You want me to whitewash
what happened for profit?

1362
01:45:23,920 --> 01:45:26,685
We are asking you to be pragmatic.

1363
01:45:42,680 --> 01:45:44,762
The Essex was stove by a white whale.

1364
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:48,924
And those of us that survived
in ill-equipped whaleboats

1365
01:45:49,080 --> 01:45:52,050
had to commit abominations
in order to survive.

1366
01:45:53,360 --> 01:45:56,967
And, on our return,
we're expected to spread barefaced lies

1367
01:45:58,120 --> 01:46:00,248
so that you, the ship owners of Nantucket,

1368
01:46:01,280 --> 01:46:04,204
might line your pockets
and sleep well at night?

1369
01:46:05,440 --> 01:46:07,442
Well, I will not embroider the truth.

1370
01:46:08,560 --> 01:46:10,449
Nor should you, George.

1371
01:46:29,960 --> 01:46:32,327
NICKERSON: That last time I saw him...

1372
01:46:32,480 --> 01:46:33,720
Mr. Chase, sir!

1373
01:46:34,480 --> 01:46:37,245
I couldn't find the right words
to say what I wanted to.

1374
01:46:38,320 --> 01:46:39,321
Thomas.

1375
01:46:40,720 --> 01:46:42,449
NICKERSON: Perhaps there are no words.

1376
01:46:42,760 --> 01:46:43,807
Um...

1377
01:46:44,960 --> 01:46:48,487
I'm gonna be on my way to Falmouth and...

1378
01:46:51,200 --> 01:46:52,406
It's...

1379
01:46:53,400 --> 01:46:56,961
It's been an honor, sir, to sail with you.

1380
01:47:01,040 --> 01:47:03,042
The honor's been mine, Mr. Nickerson.

1381
01:47:20,320 --> 01:47:21,367
Here.

1382
01:47:27,040 --> 01:47:28,565
Good luck out there, Thomas.

1383
01:47:30,280 --> 01:47:31,520
And you, sir.

1384
01:48:00,720 --> 01:48:03,530
Next day, George Pollard was called
before the inquiry.

1385
01:48:04,320 --> 01:48:06,322
(CROWD MURMURING)

1386
01:48:08,440 --> 01:48:09,965
MASON: Gentlemen, Captain George Pollard.

1387
01:48:11,360 --> 01:48:13,203
NICKERSON: And all the important men
in Nantucket were there.

1388
01:48:14,920 --> 01:48:16,524
It was a formality.

1389
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:20,844
Good day to you, Captain. Please sit down.

1390
01:48:25,760 --> 01:48:27,125
For the record, then...

1391
01:48:29,600 --> 01:48:34,607
The Essex was stove by a white whale
1,200 leagues west of Ecuador.

1392
01:48:35,120 --> 01:48:37,885
It was as if Owen Chase himself
had spoken.

1393
01:48:39,920 --> 01:48:41,285
Told them the truth.

1394
01:48:45,440 --> 01:48:47,568
Captain Pollard's conscience was clear.

1395
01:48:49,160 --> 01:48:50,286
But the inquiry was a sham.

1396
01:48:53,040 --> 01:48:54,201
Pollard went out again,

1397
01:48:57,560 --> 01:48:59,164
looking for the white whale.

1398
01:48:59,880 --> 01:49:01,120
He never found it.

1399
01:49:02,880 --> 01:49:05,042
He ran a second ship aground off Hawaii.

1400
01:49:06,560 --> 01:49:07,800
Twice cursed.

1401
01:49:09,640 --> 01:49:10,687
Never sailed again.

1402
01:49:11,240 --> 01:49:12,321
And Owen Chase?

1403
01:49:14,280 --> 01:49:16,009
He was a man of his word.

1404
01:49:16,840 --> 01:49:19,127
First, he sent a boat back
to Ducie Island.

1405
01:49:20,640 --> 01:49:22,051
Mr. Joy had passed.

1406
01:49:22,760 --> 01:49:25,969
But the other three were,
incredibly, still alive.

1407
01:49:28,920 --> 01:49:30,206
And then?

1408
01:49:31,120 --> 01:49:34,488
And then he packed up his family
and moved to New Bedford.

1409
01:49:36,480 --> 01:49:38,005
Started over.

1410
01:49:38,840 --> 01:49:40,251
Became a merchant captain,

1411
01:49:41,160 --> 01:49:43,162
sailing on his own terms.

1412
01:49:52,680 --> 01:49:55,729
Well, you certainly got your
money's worth, Mr. Melville.

1413
01:49:56,280 --> 01:49:58,760
These February nights
are the longest of the year.

1414
01:49:58,920 --> 01:50:00,843
Well, you can both rest now.

1415
01:50:01,080 --> 01:50:02,411
Believe me,

1416
01:50:02,560 --> 01:50:04,688
I shall not be resting for some time.

1417
01:50:05,480 --> 01:50:06,686
NICKERSON: Why?

1418
01:50:07,680 --> 01:50:09,284
You got your story.

1419
01:50:09,840 --> 01:50:12,366
You know, your plot. It's all there.

1420
01:50:12,840 --> 01:50:16,162
Maybe it wasn't a plot I was after.

1421
01:50:16,880 --> 01:50:18,530
No. What, then?

1422
01:50:19,360 --> 01:50:22,842
- Something else you've given me tonight.
- And what's that?

1423
01:50:23,920 --> 01:50:27,811
The courage to go where
one does not want to go.

1424
01:50:29,960 --> 01:50:31,405
Mr. Melville,

1425
01:50:32,120 --> 01:50:34,566
what you've heard, what I've told you,

1426
01:50:37,720 --> 01:50:41,725
will it all be of service to your book?

1427
01:50:43,400 --> 01:50:46,483
It will be a work of fiction,
Mr. Nickerson,

1428
01:50:47,800 --> 01:50:49,450
inspired by truth.

1429
01:50:51,160 --> 01:50:54,243
But I don't believe
I'll feel the need to use all of it.

1430
01:51:03,400 --> 01:51:05,289
- Thank you.
- Here.

1431
01:51:05,440 --> 01:51:08,762
- Take that with you.
- No. The money is for you. I insist.

1432
01:51:09,920 --> 01:51:11,604
I insist you keep it.

1433
01:51:11,760 --> 01:51:15,526
And I insist one person
in this conversation is sober.

1434
01:51:26,440 --> 01:51:29,091
- So it's back to, uh...
- Pittsfield, Massachusetts.

1435
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:31,490
Well, good luck.

1436
01:51:33,280 --> 01:51:34,441
Thank you.

1437
01:51:38,080 --> 01:51:39,286
You know,

1438
01:51:40,160 --> 01:51:43,528
I heard a man from Pennsylvania
drilled a hole in the ground recently

1439
01:51:44,600 --> 01:51:46,125
and found oil.

1440
01:51:46,760 --> 01:51:47,966
That can't be true.

1441
01:51:48,760 --> 01:51:49,921
I heard it, too.

1442
01:51:52,520 --> 01:51:54,124
Oil from the ground.

1443
