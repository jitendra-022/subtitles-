1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,431
What I'm about
to tell you is top secret.

2
00:00:05,804 --> 00:00:07,283
Oh, hi. Tyrell Wellick.

3
00:00:07,284 --> 00:00:08,613
You wanna do these together then?

4
00:00:08,614 --> 00:00:10,624
- Pure molly.
- No, Shayla.

5
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:12,192
I need you to come to Allsafe.

6
00:00:12,228 --> 00:00:13,427
Shit, they're in the network.

7
00:00:13,462 --> 00:00:15,262
This is it. fsociety.

8
00:00:15,298 --> 00:00:17,264
They're telling me to leave it here.

9
00:00:19,041 --> 00:00:20,100
Who are you?

10
00:00:20,136 --> 00:00:21,468
I think
you should come with me.

11
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:22,803
Yeah, that's Darlene.

12
00:00:22,805 --> 00:00:24,855
You are gonna modify the DAT file.

13
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:26,473
Put Colby's IP in there.

14
00:00:26,525 --> 00:00:28,025
You do that, you'll have set in motion

15
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:30,692
the largest revolution
the world will ever see.

16
00:00:31,516 --> 00:00:32,514
_

17
00:00:33,916 --> 00:00:35,699
Sources have confirmed

18
00:00:35,735 --> 00:00:37,868
the hacks were in part
tied to Colby's terminal.

19
00:00:37,903 --> 00:00:40,487
Sir, step inside the car.

20
00:00:45,878 --> 00:00:47,544
Bonsoir, Elliot.

21
00:01:11,187 --> 00:01:13,520
"Give a man a
gun and he can rob a bank,

22
00:01:13,556 --> 00:01:17,558
but give a man a bank,
and he can rob the world."

23
00:01:17,593 --> 00:01:19,960
It's a bit of a silly expression, actually.

24
00:01:19,995 --> 00:01:22,896
A little reductive, but still...

25
00:01:22,932 --> 00:01:24,331
I like it,

26
00:01:24,367 --> 00:01:26,300
for the same reason most people hate it,

27
00:01:26,335 --> 00:01:29,403
because to me it means that power belongs

28
00:01:29,438 --> 00:01:31,705
to the people that take it.

29
00:01:31,741 --> 00:01:34,375
Nothing to do with their
hard work, strong ambitions,

30
00:01:34,410 --> 00:01:37,678
or rightful qualifications, no.

31
00:01:37,713 --> 00:01:43,350
The actual will to take is often
the only thing that's necessary.

32
00:01:43,386 --> 00:01:45,586
I'm sorry to bring you in like this.

33
00:01:45,621 --> 00:01:48,889
Technically what we're doing
might be considered illegal,

34
00:01:48,924 --> 00:01:50,691
which is why I'm surrounded

35
00:01:50,726 --> 00:01:54,261
by eleven of our most annoying lawyers.

36
00:01:56,265 --> 00:01:59,666
Elliot Alderson...

37
00:01:59,702 --> 00:02:02,069
I want to offer you

38
00:02:02,104 --> 00:02:07,074
a position here at Evil Corp.

39
00:02:07,076 --> 00:02:10,744
I want you to head our
cybersecurity division.

40
00:02:10,796 --> 00:02:13,714
Except I can't officially
offer you anything

41
00:02:13,749 --> 00:02:18,218
since we have this non-compete
with your employer, Allsafe.

42
00:02:18,254 --> 00:02:20,587
But if you do this of your own accord...

43
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:22,589
when you do this...

44
00:02:22,641 --> 00:02:27,060
you'll be a multi-millionaire
within the next five years.

45
00:02:27,096 --> 00:02:29,096
What do you say?

46
00:02:38,324 --> 00:02:39,606
Can I...

47
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:43,610
Can I think about it?

48
00:02:48,784 --> 00:02:51,535
Gentlemen, I need the room.

49
00:02:51,587 --> 00:02:53,837
Yes, thank you. Yes, yes.

50
00:03:12,691 --> 00:03:14,892
You know,

51
00:03:14,944 --> 00:03:19,146
Evil Corp has just named me interim CTO.

52
00:03:19,198 --> 00:03:21,982
It won't be long until it's official.

53
00:03:22,034 --> 00:03:27,154
I will be the youngest executive
this company has ever seen.

54
00:03:27,206 --> 00:03:29,289
I should track down these hackers out there

55
00:03:29,325 --> 00:03:31,408
just to thank them.

56
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:33,577
In a way, it's kind of, um...

57
00:03:33,629 --> 00:03:35,963
What's the word in English?

58
00:03:35,998 --> 00:03:38,999
Serendipitous? Right?

59
00:03:55,317 --> 00:03:59,520
You know, by the end of the quarter,

60
00:03:59,522 --> 00:04:01,188
we're going to revamp our entire network

61
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:03,824
and consolidate our security protocols.

62
00:04:03,859 --> 00:04:06,693
We're going to handle
everything internally,

63
00:04:06,745 --> 00:04:09,780
which means all of our
vendors, including Allsafe,

64
00:04:09,832 --> 00:04:11,698
will be cut loose.

65
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:15,035
And it's no secret that once
Allsafe loses us as a client,

66
00:04:15,087 --> 00:04:17,004
they'll be fini.

67
00:04:17,039 --> 00:04:18,705
And when that happens,

68
00:04:18,707 --> 00:04:21,291
I want you to be where you belong:

69
00:04:21,343 --> 00:04:22,843
here with me.

70
00:04:22,878 --> 00:04:27,514
This is an important choice
you're making, Elliot.

71
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:29,299
I just wanted you to know all the facts

72
00:04:29,351 --> 00:04:32,352
before you made your final decision.

73
00:04:43,732 --> 00:04:46,900
I think I'm happy where I am.

74
00:05:11,143 --> 00:05:14,428
Well, I thought I'd ask.

75
00:05:56,472 --> 00:05:58,972
Call this number if you need to
get in touch with Mr. Wellick.

76
00:05:59,024 --> 00:06:02,776
You can call me Mr. X.

77
00:06:04,813 --> 00:06:07,781
Come on, you've never seen JFK?

78
00:06:07,816 --> 00:06:10,651
Oliver Stone movie?

79
00:06:10,703 --> 00:06:13,070
Sir, I gotta be honest.
That's embarrassing.

80
00:06:13,122 --> 00:06:14,988
Do yourself a favor and watch it.

81
00:06:15,024 --> 00:06:17,124
And pay, for Christ's sake.

82
00:06:17,159 --> 00:06:19,660
Anyway, you can call me
Mr. Sutherland for now.

83
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:23,163
Don't hesitate to reach
me when you're ready.

84
00:06:23,165 --> 00:06:25,666
We're always close by.

85
00:06:36,078 --> 00:06:37,594
I'm gonna set a date right now...

86
00:06:37,646 --> 00:06:39,096
- No, we're not.
- For later.

87
00:06:39,148 --> 00:06:40,263
I gotta go, thank you very much.

88
00:06:40,315 --> 00:06:42,115
- You gonna have me up?
- No.

89
00:06:42,151 --> 00:06:44,518
- Gonna have me up?
- No, stop.

90
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:46,653
- I'm coming up.
- No, you're not coming up.

91
00:06:46,689 --> 00:06:48,271
Another time. Okay, I gotta go.

92
00:06:48,323 --> 00:06:49,740
Come on.

93
00:06:54,530 --> 00:06:56,863
- Everything all right?
- Yeah, he's just a creeper.

94
00:06:56,915 --> 00:07:01,451
I hate it when your
employers can't take a hint.

95
00:07:05,507 --> 00:07:07,207
Hey, is your radiator messed up?

96
00:07:07,209 --> 00:07:10,510
Because it's like 3,000
degrees in my apartment.

97
00:07:11,597 --> 00:07:15,048
Hey, are you okay? You seem off.

98
00:07:17,052 --> 00:07:19,803
While we're here, you mind if I reup?

99
00:07:19,855 --> 00:07:21,638
A little early to reup, don't you think?

100
00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:24,474
I'm deviating from the schedule a little.

101
00:07:24,526 --> 00:07:27,644
Whoa, never thought I'd see
the day, Mr. Stricty Pants,

102
00:07:27,696 --> 00:07:30,530
but okie dokie.

103
00:07:30,566 --> 00:07:33,200
Oh, yeah. Shit, I'm out of the other ones.

104
00:07:33,235 --> 00:07:36,069
No, just the morphine. It's good.

105
00:07:36,071 --> 00:07:38,205
Uh, no, you made me promise
never to give you these

106
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,040
unless I had your Subs.

107
00:07:40,075 --> 00:07:43,343
- Shayla.
- No, Elliot.

108
00:07:43,378 --> 00:07:45,245
Promises matter, okay?

109
00:07:45,247 --> 00:07:47,414
I take this shit to heart.

110
00:07:52,254 --> 00:07:53,920
Oh, my God.

111
00:07:53,922 --> 00:07:56,256
Fine, but you have to
promise me you won't do a lot

112
00:07:56,258 --> 00:07:58,091
until I get your withdrawal meds, okay?

113
00:07:58,093 --> 00:08:01,928
I'll go see Fernando later or something.

114
00:08:01,930 --> 00:08:03,764
No, you have to say it.

115
00:08:06,985 --> 00:08:08,268
I promise.

116
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:20,747
Hey, man.

117
00:08:20,783 --> 00:08:22,866
What, you think I forgot about you?

118
00:08:22,918 --> 00:08:26,169
Trust me, I need you now more than ever.

119
00:08:29,174 --> 00:08:31,258
We gotta get to work.

120
00:08:31,293 --> 00:08:33,426
Hacking Tyrell Wellick,
you'd think it'd be tricky,

121
00:08:33,462 --> 00:08:35,712
but it wasn't... Evil Corp's
corporate mail servers,

122
00:08:35,764 --> 00:08:37,798
they haven't patched
anything since Shellshock.

123
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,800
He doesn't even use two-step verification.

124
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:41,768
His password was just
his wife's maiden name

125
00:08:41,804 --> 00:08:44,838
and Sweden's independence date, 6-6.

126
00:08:44,873 --> 00:08:47,107
One six away from the obvious, but still,

127
00:08:47,142 --> 00:08:50,143
this is bad noob practice.

128
00:08:52,447 --> 00:08:54,447
These emails...

129
00:08:57,452 --> 00:09:00,487
His life... it's nice, happy, perfect.

130
00:09:00,522 --> 00:09:03,089
This doesn't make sense.

131
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:07,794
Did he know I was going to hack him?

132
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:09,830
Did he let me?

133
00:09:12,551 --> 00:09:15,051
I'm gonna need to wipe everything.

134
00:10:09,466 --> 00:10:12,192
I know, I
know, taking more than I should.

135
00:10:12,227 --> 00:10:16,363
I'm breaking my rule, but
come on, it's an off week.

136
00:10:54,269 --> 00:10:56,236
Come on.

137
00:10:59,608 --> 00:11:02,409
Yo. My man, you gotta...

138
00:11:02,444 --> 00:11:05,161
You gotta deuce it out
over here, all right?

139
00:11:07,282 --> 00:11:11,451
Yo, you gotta do your
business up in here, all right?

140
00:11:11,453 --> 00:11:12,619
Hey...

141
00:11:12,671 --> 00:11:17,757
You got this. You got this.

142
00:11:44,736 --> 00:11:47,866
Terry Colby, the chief
technology officer of...

143
00:11:47,867 --> 00:11:50,240
Terry Colby's
arrest is on everyone's mind.

144
00:11:50,292 --> 00:11:55,328
Screen. Might as well be
the same thing nowadays.

145
00:11:55,330 --> 00:11:57,297
How do I go back to work after this?

146
00:11:57,332 --> 00:11:59,299
How can I focus on anything?

147
00:11:59,334 --> 00:12:01,801
And when's Mr. Robot
going to contact me again?

148
00:12:01,837 --> 00:12:03,970
What's he waiting for?

149
00:12:04,006 --> 00:12:07,257
Did I just destroy a
man's life for no reason?

150
00:12:07,309 --> 00:12:09,759
I'm gonna talk to HR
about a salary bump for you.

151
00:12:09,811 --> 00:12:11,177
- Oh, please.
- No, no.

152
00:12:11,229 --> 00:12:13,096
Take the raise.

153
00:12:13,148 --> 00:12:17,350
It's not gonna be much, but
it's the best I can do right now.

154
00:12:17,352 --> 00:12:18,685
Elliot...

155
00:12:18,737 --> 00:12:20,737
You saved the company.

156
00:12:23,992 --> 00:12:27,861
Now...

157
00:12:27,863 --> 00:12:31,281
Why didn't you tell me about the DAT file?

158
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:33,533
You could've come in here at
any time before the meeting

159
00:12:33,585 --> 00:12:35,869
to say you found something, but you didn't.

160
00:12:35,871 --> 00:12:39,873
I gotta be honest. I
found that kind of curious.

161
00:12:42,377 --> 00:12:45,879
Yeah, I didn't know what I had.

162
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:48,131
Could've easily been a junk file.

163
00:12:48,183 --> 00:12:49,466
C'mon...

164
00:12:49,518 --> 00:12:50,967
You're never sure about anything

165
00:12:51,019 --> 00:12:54,020
unless there's something to be sure about.

166
00:12:54,056 --> 00:12:57,857
Maybe you don't know me that well.

167
00:12:59,861 --> 00:13:02,195
Regardless,

168
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:05,732
I still need you to stay
on it, now more than ever.

169
00:13:05,734 --> 00:13:07,233
I mean, who knows what

170
00:13:07,235 --> 00:13:08,701
these fsociety hackers
are going to do next.

171
00:13:08,737 --> 00:13:10,320
What did he just say?

172
00:13:10,372 --> 00:13:13,406
- What did you just say?
- The ones working with Colby.

173
00:13:13,408 --> 00:13:15,909
Who knows how deep these
data dumps are going to get,

174
00:13:15,961 --> 00:13:17,077
and Evil Corp is...

175
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:19,662
What're you talking about?

176
00:13:19,714 --> 00:13:21,581
There's a twist.

177
00:13:21,583 --> 00:13:23,583
You're usually the one a step ahead of me.

178
00:13:23,635 --> 00:13:25,919
They hit the mother lode during the breach.

179
00:13:25,921 --> 00:13:29,255
Potentially terabytes
worth of emails and files.

180
00:13:29,257 --> 00:13:31,124
They're threatening to dump everything

181
00:13:31,159 --> 00:13:33,343
unless the FBI frees Colby.

182
00:13:33,395 --> 00:13:36,396
They released the video this morning.

183
00:13:43,271 --> 00:13:46,573
Hello, Evil Corp. We are fsociety.

184
00:13:46,608 --> 00:13:48,575
Over the years, we have been watching you.

185
00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:50,777
Your financial abuse of the poor;

186
00:13:50,829 --> 00:13:52,612
your corruption of governments;

187
00:13:52,664 --> 00:13:55,782
your cover-ups of the murder
of innocent, ordinary citizens,

188
00:13:55,834 --> 00:13:57,784
all for the sake of a profit.

189
00:13:57,786 --> 00:14:01,955
This is why we at fsociety
have decided you must die.

190
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:05,625
We are malicious and
hostile. We do not compromise.

191
00:14:05,627 --> 00:14:07,127
We are relentless.

192
00:14:07,129 --> 00:14:09,379
We will not stop until every tentacle

193
00:14:09,431 --> 00:14:13,299
of your evil monstrosity
is sliced off at the nerve.

194
00:14:13,351 --> 00:14:15,635
But we are also not without mercy.

195
00:14:15,687 --> 00:14:18,304
Our latest hack was our last warning.

196
00:14:18,306 --> 00:14:21,975
Meet our demands, and we will
consider not destroying you.

197
00:14:21,977 --> 00:14:24,561
First, release our leader Terry Colby

198
00:14:24,613 --> 00:14:27,113
from your illegitimate prison immediately.

199
00:14:27,149 --> 00:14:30,150
Second, release all the people of the world

200
00:14:30,185 --> 00:14:33,570
from your even more
illegitimate prisons of debt.

201
00:14:33,622 --> 00:14:36,156
Third, dissolve your corporation

202
00:14:36,158 --> 00:14:39,826
and donate all your assets
to charities around the world.

203
00:14:39,878 --> 00:14:42,195
This proposal is non-negotiable.

204
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:45,165
The people are realizing they
don't have freedom of choice

205
00:14:45,167 --> 00:14:46,332
so long as you exist.

206
00:14:46,384 --> 00:14:48,301
The people are waking up,

207
00:14:48,336 --> 00:14:51,171
no longer accepting your economic slavery.

208
00:14:51,173 --> 00:14:55,008
Meet these demands, or we will kill you.

209
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:56,843
Consider yourself warned.

210
00:15:01,683 --> 00:15:02,982
Play it again.

211
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:06,798
Yo, yo, yo, yo, my album just dropped.

212
00:15:06,833 --> 00:15:09,734
Yo, please buy my CD.
Only cost you 20 likes.

213
00:15:09,786 --> 00:15:12,070
Yo, it'll give you the
feels, y'all, I swear.

214
00:15:12,122 --> 00:15:13,371
The CD's free. All's I ask is you Tweet.

215
00:15:13,406 --> 00:15:15,240
Help my social media outreach.

216
00:15:15,242 --> 00:15:17,208
You know, be like, "I
want to set up this meeting.

217
00:15:17,244 --> 00:15:20,412
It's like a very, like a... " Oh, Elliot!

218
00:15:20,732 --> 00:15:22,141
Hey, congrats, man.

219
00:15:22,142 --> 00:15:24,798
Allsafe is all over the
internet today because of you.

220
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:27,284
Dude, we should celebrate.
We have this Groupon

221
00:15:27,336 --> 00:15:29,286
for four at Morton's on Thursday.

222
00:15:29,288 --> 00:15:31,422
This other couple we were
going with totally bailed.

223
00:15:31,457 --> 00:15:32,790
Why don't you come with?

224
00:15:32,792 --> 00:15:34,792
Their steaks are badass. It's $29.95...

225
00:15:34,827 --> 00:15:35,926
I'm not sure that
Elliot would like that.

226
00:15:35,962 --> 00:15:37,011
Yeah, okay.

227
00:15:37,046 --> 00:15:39,630
Yeah? Okay. Awesome, man.

228
00:15:39,632 --> 00:15:42,633
And, hey, why don't we
make it a double date?

229
00:15:42,635 --> 00:15:44,018
I heard that you had a girlfriend.

230
00:15:44,053 --> 00:15:46,186
Ollie, you weren't
supposed to say anything.

231
00:15:46,222 --> 00:15:47,638
Babe, it's cool.
Elliot's okay with it.

232
00:15:47,690 --> 00:15:49,974
Yeah, okay, sure. I... have to go.

233
00:15:49,976 --> 00:15:53,560
Um, my neighbor's complaining
about the dog barking again.

234
00:15:59,318 --> 00:16:02,404
- Since when does he have a dog?
- Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo.

235
00:16:02,405 --> 00:16:03,454
You look like a beautiful couple.

236
00:16:03,489 --> 00:16:04,705
Yo, my album just dropped,

237
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:06,206
You like rap, hip-hop?

238
00:16:06,242 --> 00:16:08,542
Yo, this shit is deep, lyrical, poetic.

239
00:16:08,577 --> 00:16:10,210
Yo, your girl will like
this, my man, I swear.

240
00:16:10,246 --> 00:16:11,462
Come on, bro, you've
been outside our building

241
00:16:11,497 --> 00:16:12,663
for two weeks now.

242
00:16:12,665 --> 00:16:13,998
All right, you know, I'll take it,

243
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,332
if you leave us alone.

244
00:16:15,384 --> 00:16:17,334
Thank you, thank you, man, thank you.

245
00:16:17,336 --> 00:16:19,503
And I'll tweet, but only
if I like it, all right?

246
00:16:19,555 --> 00:16:21,388
I only have 48 followers, but it's growing.

247
00:16:21,424 --> 00:16:22,973
- No doubt, no doubt.
- Some tastemakers in there so...

248
00:16:23,009 --> 00:16:24,058
I feel you, I feel you.

249
00:16:24,093 --> 00:16:25,309
- Yeah.
- All right.

250
00:16:25,344 --> 00:16:26,677
Yo, I appreciate it, man, really.

251
00:16:26,729 --> 00:16:28,062
- You guys have a good day.
- Yeah, you too.

252
00:16:28,097 --> 00:16:29,396
Thank you so much. Check track two out.

253
00:16:29,432 --> 00:16:32,349
- Track two.
- All right, man.

254
00:16:32,351 --> 00:16:33,734
This was never part of the plan.

255
00:16:33,769 --> 00:16:36,020
Data dumps? Releasing Terry Colby?

256
00:16:36,072 --> 00:16:37,855
None of this makes sense.

257
00:16:37,907 --> 00:16:40,407
Need to cut off all ties with fsociety.

258
00:16:40,443 --> 00:16:41,859
Need to disconnect.

259
00:16:41,861 --> 00:16:43,577
We need to call in sick
and lie low for a...

260
00:16:59,712 --> 00:17:02,713
Dude! Jesus Christ! I am naked, asshole!

261
00:17:02,715 --> 00:17:04,548
Don't stare at me!

262
00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:06,266
Why the hell are you in my shower?

263
00:17:06,302 --> 00:17:08,352
Well, I was waiting for you.

264
00:17:08,387 --> 00:17:09,720
You were supposed to come last night.

265
00:17:09,772 --> 00:17:12,222
- Did you forget?
- Come? Where?

266
00:17:12,274 --> 00:17:14,274
It's fine, everyone's coming later.

267
00:17:20,649 --> 00:17:23,117
I'm stealing your clothes.

268
00:17:23,152 --> 00:17:26,704
My dress has cum stains on it.

269
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:31,075
Jesus, I am just messing with you.

270
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:32,609
My stuff is just in the wash.

271
00:17:32,645 --> 00:17:35,579
I'm gonna borrow this for the time being.

272
00:17:35,581 --> 00:17:37,297
Oh, by the way,

273
00:17:37,333 --> 00:17:39,800
your dog shat on your bed.

274
00:17:39,835 --> 00:17:42,920
You gotta walk that thing.

275
00:17:42,922 --> 00:17:46,056
Hey, please take Flipper for a while.

276
00:17:46,092 --> 00:17:48,058
She probably needs a walk or something.

277
00:17:48,094 --> 00:17:49,893
She keeps shitting everywhere.

278
00:17:49,929 --> 00:17:51,095
Of course she needs a walk, Elliot.

279
00:17:51,097 --> 00:17:52,563
She's a friggin' dog.

280
00:17:52,598 --> 00:17:56,100
Yo, I want to stop and get
some froyo before we go.

281
00:17:57,603 --> 00:18:00,437
Uh, I'll be back later.

282
00:18:00,439 --> 00:18:03,440
- I owe you.
- Yeah, big time.

283
00:18:14,954 --> 00:18:17,154
How do you know where I live?

284
00:18:17,189 --> 00:18:19,990
Why wouldn't I know where you live?

285
00:18:20,025 --> 00:18:24,595
I don't know. I don't know where you live.

286
00:18:24,630 --> 00:18:26,513
Well,

287
00:18:26,549 --> 00:18:30,300
I don't live anywhere at the present.

288
00:18:30,352 --> 00:18:34,304
The douche I was dating
proposed to me, can you believe?

289
00:18:34,356 --> 00:18:37,024
I mean, what an asshole.

290
00:18:37,059 --> 00:18:39,777
Anyways, we got into
this huge fight, and...

291
00:18:39,812 --> 00:18:41,678
What the hell am I doing?

292
00:18:41,714 --> 00:18:44,148
This chick is out of
her mind batshit crazy.

293
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:46,283
I gotta go back, tell Gideon everything.

294
00:18:46,318 --> 00:18:47,534
He'll understand, right?

295
00:18:47,570 --> 00:18:48,869
He'll know what to do.

296
00:18:48,904 --> 00:18:51,121
It's whatevs. He'll take me back.

297
00:18:51,157 --> 00:18:52,539
He's just gotta get over this whole

298
00:18:52,575 --> 00:18:55,542
"love is forever" bullshit.

299
00:18:55,578 --> 00:18:57,494
I'll do my disappearing act for a minute,

300
00:18:57,546 --> 00:18:59,463
and then he'll come to his senses.

301
00:18:59,498 --> 00:19:00,664
Stand clear of the closing door.

302
00:19:00,666 --> 00:19:03,217
You know, it's our thing.

303
00:19:03,252 --> 00:19:05,669
Quick!

304
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:15,896
Can she see them, too?

305
00:19:15,931 --> 00:19:17,381
What?

306
00:19:17,416 --> 00:19:21,185
I like to stay on my toes.

307
00:19:21,237 --> 00:19:25,155
Speaking of, that's, like, one
of the most annoying things...

308
00:19:25,191 --> 00:19:28,859
But what if Tyrell finds
out? What will he do?

309
00:19:28,911 --> 00:19:31,245
Shit, there's basically
no scenario in which

310
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:34,031
I'm not getting killed or going to jail.

311
00:19:34,083 --> 00:19:37,701
Because I wanted a turtle,
and he was like, "No..."

312
00:19:37,753 --> 00:19:40,087
I might need to crash with
you for a couple of nights.

313
00:19:40,122 --> 00:19:42,372
That's cool, right?

314
00:19:42,424 --> 00:19:44,041
Seriously?

315
00:19:44,043 --> 00:19:46,376
Fine! I'll crash at Mobley's.

316
00:19:46,378 --> 00:19:48,512
Don't love dogs anyway.

317
00:19:48,547 --> 00:19:50,264
Especially ones that shit in your bed.

318
00:19:50,299 --> 00:19:52,382
I mean, how do you live
like that, honestly?

319
00:19:52,434 --> 00:19:54,218
How do you go to sleep when
you know that there's...

320
00:19:54,270 --> 00:19:55,686
For all we know,

321
00:19:55,721 --> 00:19:57,387
I could be walking into a trap right now.

322
00:19:57,389 --> 00:19:59,556
We could be dead the second
I walk through that door.

323
00:19:59,608 --> 00:20:03,443
Come on, kid. We got big things in store.

324
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:05,312
Big things.

325
00:20:13,764 --> 00:20:16,231
Man of the hour. Take a curtsy.

326
00:20:21,037 --> 00:20:22,753
Goddamn ducks.

327
00:20:25,508 --> 00:20:26,958
Hey, hey, man!

328
00:20:27,010 --> 00:20:28,960
What's... oh. Shit, sorry, sorry, dude.

329
00:20:29,012 --> 00:20:30,711
Um, okay.

330
00:20:30,713 --> 00:20:32,847
Anyway, just, awesome work, man.

331
00:20:32,882 --> 00:20:33,965
Really awesome.

332
00:20:34,017 --> 00:20:35,099
Right on, man. Right on.

333
00:20:35,134 --> 00:20:36,884
- Real cool.
- Great.

334
00:20:36,886 --> 00:20:39,020
So now that we're all done
going down on each other,

335
00:20:39,055 --> 00:20:41,689
can we please hear the plan?

336
00:20:41,724 --> 00:20:43,107
Where are we at with Steel Mountain?

337
00:20:43,142 --> 00:20:44,492
If I'm not mistaken,

338
00:20:44,527 --> 00:20:46,327
these lines aren't 100% safe yet,

339
00:20:46,362 --> 00:20:48,029
and we still haven't made
the Colby project disappear.

340
00:20:48,064 --> 00:20:49,123
Seriously?

341
00:20:49,132 --> 00:20:51,182
It's been weeks. Any links or traces

342
00:20:51,234 --> 00:20:52,517
would have been owned by now.

343
00:20:52,569 --> 00:20:54,819
The lines are clean, Boss, I swear.

344
00:20:54,854 --> 00:20:57,205
- Thank you.
- I mean, um...

345
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:59,340
if it makes you feel better,
Romero and I can check...

346
00:20:59,376 --> 00:21:01,693
Great! Make me feel great.

347
00:21:01,745 --> 00:21:04,912
I'm gonna hang back over
here, collect my thoughts.

348
00:21:07,534 --> 00:21:08,750
Ohh!

349
00:21:14,257 --> 00:21:15,707
What's her deal?

350
00:21:15,759 --> 00:21:17,625
Ah, she's a complicated woman.

351
00:21:17,627 --> 00:21:19,727
Most malware coders are. Am I right?

352
00:21:19,763 --> 00:21:22,230
She showed up at my apartment.

353
00:21:22,265 --> 00:21:23,798
Why does she know where I live?

354
00:21:23,833 --> 00:21:25,466
Let's not focus on her. That'll be like

355
00:21:25,502 --> 00:21:27,351
entering a bad K-hole
you'll never wake up from.

356
00:21:27,387 --> 00:21:30,438
Instead, I need you to focus on
the next phase of our project.

357
00:21:30,473 --> 00:21:34,142
Comet, the natural gas
plant up around Albany?

358
00:21:36,146 --> 00:21:39,063
We're gonna blow it up.

359
00:21:39,115 --> 00:21:41,949
Why would you blow...

360
00:21:41,985 --> 00:21:43,901
Comet plant's right next to Steel Mountain.

361
00:21:43,953 --> 00:21:45,987
Which, as you know,

362
00:21:45,989 --> 00:21:48,456
is the off-site and data storage facility

363
00:21:48,491 --> 00:21:49,907
for every corporation in the S&P,

364
00:21:49,959 --> 00:21:51,209
including everyone's favorite...

365
00:21:51,244 --> 00:21:54,045
- Evil Corp.
- Bingo!

366
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:56,547
You're gonna destroy their tape backups.

367
00:21:56,583 --> 00:21:58,800
They're gonna be looking
out for something like that.

368
00:21:58,835 --> 00:22:01,219
They've been on high
alert ever since the hack.

369
00:22:01,254 --> 00:22:03,137
From what I heard, they've
caught their hacker.

370
00:22:03,173 --> 00:22:05,473
- Haven't they?
- No, they haven't.

371
00:22:05,508 --> 00:22:08,009
- Tyrell Wellick knows.
- What they want him to know!

372
00:22:08,011 --> 00:22:10,061
He's a corporate robot
just like the rest of them.

373
00:22:10,096 --> 00:22:12,430
Besides, the entire
company is gonna be reeling

374
00:22:12,482 --> 00:22:14,348
from all the data dumps
we've got in store for them...

375
00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:15,817
and man, do we have some goodies.

376
00:22:15,852 --> 00:22:17,819
Some good old-fashioned executive racism,

377
00:22:17,854 --> 00:22:19,854
sexism, fascism.

378
00:22:19,856 --> 00:22:21,773
Trust me, we are gonna
"ism" so much all over them

379
00:22:21,825 --> 00:22:23,574
they won't be able to see straight.

380
00:22:23,610 --> 00:22:25,777
And asking for Colby's
release as ransom was genius.

381
00:22:25,829 --> 00:22:27,328
That'll only make his spotlight bigger,

382
00:22:27,363 --> 00:22:28,946
keeping it off us.

383
00:22:28,998 --> 00:22:31,833
That neat little ditty was Trenton's idea.

384
00:22:31,868 --> 00:22:34,085
She may look innocent, but I'd be careful.

385
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:36,921
She's got some Allah Akbar in her.

386
00:22:36,956 --> 00:22:38,539
And while all that's going on,

387
00:22:38,541 --> 00:22:41,042
you will use your
Allsafe security clearance

388
00:22:41,044 --> 00:22:43,544
to hack the Comet PLC,
increase the pressure,

389
00:22:43,546 --> 00:22:45,379
causing a gas pipeline explosion

390
00:22:45,381 --> 00:22:47,181
making Steel Mountain go kablooey

391
00:22:47,217 --> 00:22:49,217
along with Evil Corp's soul.

392
00:22:54,390 --> 00:22:56,641
They know about all this?

393
00:22:56,693 --> 00:22:58,559
You're the first.

394
00:23:01,231 --> 00:23:03,231
Workers?

395
00:23:03,233 --> 00:23:04,649
Anyone living around the plant...

396
00:23:04,701 --> 00:23:06,450
They all die?

397
00:23:06,486 --> 00:23:08,236
We'll give them a head start.

398
00:23:08,238 --> 00:23:11,239
Sound some alarms. They'll be fine.

399
00:23:13,576 --> 00:23:15,409
You're blowing up a gas pipeline.

400
00:23:15,411 --> 00:23:17,545
The world is a dangerous place, Elliot,

401
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:19,130
not because of those who do evil,

402
00:23:19,165 --> 00:23:21,332
but because of those who
look on and do nothing.

403
00:23:21,384 --> 00:23:22,583
This is war.

404
00:23:22,585 --> 00:23:24,752
People will die. C'est la mort.

405
00:23:26,339 --> 00:23:27,839
And once we blow up the pipeline,

406
00:23:27,891 --> 00:23:30,141
Darlene's worm will kick into high gear

407
00:23:30,176 --> 00:23:31,843
at the U.S. data center

408
00:23:31,895 --> 00:23:35,730
which you helped to us
install, thank you very much.

409
00:23:35,765 --> 00:23:39,183
The redundant backups at their
eastern data center in China...

410
00:23:39,235 --> 00:23:41,652
the Dark Army is covering us on that.

411
00:23:41,688 --> 00:23:44,655
Dark Army? Why, man?

412
00:23:44,691 --> 00:23:46,357
They got no code. They hack for anyone:

413
00:23:46,409 --> 00:23:48,276
terrorists, North Korea, Iran, Russia...

414
00:23:48,278 --> 00:23:49,744
Which means they hate U.S. capitalism

415
00:23:49,779 --> 00:23:53,497
just as much as anyone.

416
00:23:53,533 --> 00:23:56,450
Last but not least.

417
00:23:56,452 --> 00:23:58,035
Steel Mountain.

418
00:23:58,087 --> 00:24:01,122
The hacker's dilemma. What to do

419
00:24:01,124 --> 00:24:03,007
when a bunch of data you want to destroy

420
00:24:03,042 --> 00:24:05,209
is completely off the grid?

421
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:13,401
I'm not killing anyone.

422
00:24:15,388 --> 00:24:17,605
Tell me one thing, Elliot.

423
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:19,640
Are you a one or a zero?

424
00:24:21,277 --> 00:24:22,944
That's the question you
have to ask yourself.

425
00:24:22,979 --> 00:24:25,112
Are you a yes or a no?

426
00:24:25,148 --> 00:24:27,982
Are you going to act or not?

427
00:24:30,987 --> 00:24:33,788
Yo... you've been staring
at a computer screen

428
00:24:33,823 --> 00:24:35,957
way too long, homie.

429
00:24:35,992 --> 00:24:37,708
Life's not that binary.

430
00:24:37,744 --> 00:24:39,660
Isn't it?

431
00:24:39,662 --> 00:24:41,963
Sure, there are grays...

432
00:24:41,998 --> 00:24:44,081
but when you come right
down to it, at its core,

433
00:24:44,133 --> 00:24:48,085
beneath every choice, there's
either a one or a zero.

434
00:24:48,137 --> 00:24:51,222
You either do something or you don't.

435
00:24:51,257 --> 00:24:53,841
You walk out that door,
you've decided to do nothing,

436
00:24:53,843 --> 00:24:57,678
to say no, which means
you do not come back.

437
00:24:57,680 --> 00:25:01,015
You leave, you are no
longer a part of this.

438
00:25:01,017 --> 00:25:03,901
You become a zero.

439
00:25:03,937 --> 00:25:05,686
If you stay,

440
00:25:05,688 --> 00:25:08,773
if you want to change the world,

441
00:25:08,825 --> 00:25:10,574
you become a yes.

442
00:25:10,610 --> 00:25:13,778
You become a one.

443
00:25:13,830 --> 00:25:15,947
So, I'll ask you again:

444
00:25:15,999 --> 00:25:19,250
are you a one or a zero?

445
00:25:19,285 --> 00:25:21,452
An innocent man is in
prison because of what I did.

446
00:25:21,504 --> 00:25:22,954
Come on, let's not kid ourselves!

447
00:25:23,006 --> 00:25:26,540
This has nothing to do with Colby.

448
00:25:29,545 --> 00:25:31,512
This isn't even about my revolution.

449
00:25:31,547 --> 00:25:34,215
This is more than that for you.

450
00:25:34,217 --> 00:25:37,101
This is about how those bastards
slowly killed your father

451
00:25:37,136 --> 00:25:38,769
and how you wished he'd
done something about it.

452
00:25:38,805 --> 00:25:41,689
But he didn't. Because he was a zero,

453
00:25:41,724 --> 00:25:44,225
just like you're being right now.

454
00:25:46,229 --> 00:25:48,229
Fuck you.

455
00:25:51,434 --> 00:25:54,268
Disappearing again?

456
00:25:56,272 --> 00:25:59,406
I'm not killing anyone.
Leave me out of this.

457
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,861
You don't get to disappear from this.

458
00:26:03,913 --> 00:26:05,279
We can do it with or without you,

459
00:26:05,281 --> 00:26:07,531
but you're a part of it either way!

460
00:26:07,583 --> 00:26:10,718
Yeah, even your stupid hoodie
can't protect you, bitch!

461
00:26:10,753 --> 00:26:12,253
This was a mistake.

462
00:26:12,288 --> 00:26:13,954
I've gotta turn them in.
Should I turn them in?

463
00:26:13,956 --> 00:26:16,257
Will I get into trouble? Shit, she's right.

464
00:26:16,292 --> 00:26:18,959
I'm culpable now. No, we're culpable.

465
00:26:18,961 --> 00:26:22,096
You're in this with me, so
start thinking of solutions now.

466
00:26:26,908 --> 00:26:28,908
Shayla?

467
00:26:33,881 --> 00:26:35,631
Yo, Shayla.

468
00:26:36,067 --> 00:26:38,317
Yo, bro.

469
00:26:38,369 --> 00:26:40,903
Can I help you with something?

470
00:26:43,374 --> 00:26:46,959
I, uh... just need to talk to Shayla.

471
00:26:46,994 --> 00:26:48,911
Oh, your girl.

472
00:26:48,963 --> 00:26:50,963
She in the tub.

473
00:26:55,169 --> 00:26:56,802
Shayla.

474
00:26:56,837 --> 00:26:58,837
Yo, she'll be out in a minute.

475
00:27:00,742 --> 00:27:03,859
Can sit and wait if you want.

476
00:27:03,911 --> 00:27:06,779
I think we should check on
her, make sure she's all right.

477
00:27:09,334 --> 00:27:13,202
You a funny dude. I like you.

478
00:27:13,254 --> 00:27:15,338
Don't be rude.

479
00:27:15,373 --> 00:27:18,207
Sit down and chill.

480
00:27:36,027 --> 00:27:38,561
No, that's right.

481
00:27:41,566 --> 00:27:43,616
You only do this.

482
00:27:43,651 --> 00:27:47,570
Only nigga I know that take
withdrawal meds while he using.

483
00:27:47,622 --> 00:27:49,822
That's smart.

484
00:27:49,874 --> 00:27:52,658
Probably even convinced
yourself you ain't an addict.

485
00:27:52,710 --> 00:27:55,344
Oh, shit.

486
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:57,646
Forgot to introduce myself. I'm Fernan...

487
00:27:57,682 --> 00:27:59,648
Fernando Vera, Shayla's supplier.

488
00:27:59,684 --> 00:28:01,817
One of the worst human
beings I've ever hacked.

489
00:28:01,853 --> 00:28:05,521
His password? "eatadick6969."

490
00:28:05,556 --> 00:28:07,456
Aside from the massive amounts of money

491
00:28:07,492 --> 00:28:09,125
he spends on porn and webcams,

492
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:10,393
he does all his drug transactions

493
00:28:10,428 --> 00:28:12,695
through emails, IMs, Twitter.

494
00:28:12,730 --> 00:28:15,231
The fact that the cops haven't
caught him yet is beyond me.

495
00:28:15,266 --> 00:28:16,999
If they had half a brain cell,

496
00:28:17,034 --> 00:28:19,502
they'd be able to crack
his gang's simplistic code,

497
00:28:19,537 --> 00:28:21,654
if it can even be called that.

498
00:28:21,689 --> 00:28:23,873
After only a couple of
hours of timing his tweets

499
00:28:23,908 --> 00:28:25,341
with related news articles,

500
00:28:25,376 --> 00:28:27,243
I figured out that "biscuit" and "clickety"

501
00:28:27,278 --> 00:28:29,078
clearly referenced guns.

502
00:28:29,113 --> 00:28:32,047
"Food," "sea shells" or "gas" for bullets.

503
00:28:32,083 --> 00:28:34,850
And the ultimate: "rock to sleep early."

504
00:28:34,886 --> 00:28:37,019
I haven't made the direct
connection to a hit yet,

505
00:28:37,054 --> 00:28:38,888
but the math of guns plus bullets

506
00:28:38,923 --> 00:28:41,023
usually adds up to one thing.

507
00:28:41,058 --> 00:28:42,558
I've thought about turning him in,

508
00:28:42,593 --> 00:28:44,727
but he's Shayla's only supplier.

509
00:28:44,762 --> 00:28:47,029
I take him down, I lose my drugs,

510
00:28:47,064 --> 00:28:50,366
and with everything going on
right now, I can't have that.

511
00:28:50,401 --> 00:28:53,035
You get that, though?

512
00:28:53,070 --> 00:28:55,204
Anyway, bro,

513
00:28:55,239 --> 00:28:58,407
I ain't nothing to worry about.

514
00:28:58,443 --> 00:29:01,861
Just making a drop for you.

515
00:29:01,896 --> 00:29:03,446
What's your name, anyway?

516
00:29:05,450 --> 00:29:07,149
Elliot.

517
00:29:07,201 --> 00:29:08,951
What it mean?

518
00:29:08,986 --> 00:29:11,787
What, you ain't never Googled it?

519
00:29:11,823 --> 00:29:13,355
Man, you gotta do that.

520
00:29:13,391 --> 00:29:15,624
The meaning of a person's
name is important, bro.

521
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:18,928
Yo, she good! She good.

522
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:24,700
Trust me.

523
00:29:24,735 --> 00:29:27,736
Took care of that shit myself.

524
00:29:32,243 --> 00:29:34,477
You remind me of me when I was younger,

525
00:29:34,512 --> 00:29:36,579
depressed and sullen.

526
00:29:36,614 --> 00:29:40,549
Matter of fact, tried to kill
myself, a couple of times.

527
00:29:40,585 --> 00:29:42,751
Never could get that shit right.

528
00:29:42,787 --> 00:29:45,621
Biology wasn't my strong suit.

529
00:29:46,156 --> 00:29:49,125
I hated myself, man. Still do.

530
00:29:49,126 --> 00:29:52,828
Thought that shit was a
weakness for a long time.

531
00:29:58,669 --> 00:30:02,404
Then I realized that shit was my power.

532
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:05,307
People walk around, act like
they know what hate means.

533
00:30:05,343 --> 00:30:09,745
Nah, no one does, until you hate yourself.

534
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:12,281
I mean...

535
00:30:12,316 --> 00:30:15,184
truly hate yourself.

536
00:30:15,819 --> 00:30:17,786
That's power.

537
00:30:28,850 --> 00:30:34,570
You ain't scared of me, are you?

538
00:30:34,906 --> 00:30:36,872
That's good.

539
00:30:36,908 --> 00:30:39,625
Means I didn't waste my
time making friends with you.

540
00:30:42,078 --> 00:30:44,030
You don't really need these, do you?

541
00:30:44,082 --> 00:30:48,618
Man of your courage can last
through a little withdrawal.

542
00:30:48,670 --> 00:30:53,089
Ya know, you the only
reason why I met Shayla.

543
00:30:53,124 --> 00:30:56,259
I'm the only nigga in
town carrying everything,

544
00:30:56,294 --> 00:30:58,711
including your precious Suboxone.

545
00:30:58,763 --> 00:31:02,632
So, in a weird way, I
should be thanking you.

546
00:31:02,684 --> 00:31:04,216
You brought her to me.

547
00:31:04,269 --> 00:31:07,219
Your star orbiting with
mine, gravitationally,

548
00:31:07,272 --> 00:31:10,640
brought me the love of my life, Elliot.

549
00:31:10,692 --> 00:31:12,558
I mean, this, us?

550
00:31:12,610 --> 00:31:14,393
Being here?

551
00:31:14,445 --> 00:31:16,729
This has...

552
00:31:16,781 --> 00:31:19,198
beautiful meaning.

553
00:31:19,233 --> 00:31:22,902
But make no mistake, that girl in there...

554
00:31:22,954 --> 00:31:25,221
is mine.

555
00:31:25,256 --> 00:31:27,890
I don't know what I'd do without her.

556
00:31:27,925 --> 00:31:30,426
Now, I don't know what kind of arrangement

557
00:31:30,461 --> 00:31:36,098
you had with her before,
but now that we friends...

558
00:31:36,134 --> 00:31:38,901
I trust you respect this boundary.

559
00:31:38,936 --> 00:31:40,936
Feel me?

560
00:31:50,898 --> 00:31:53,733
A dude earlier today
gave me that same look.

561
00:31:53,768 --> 00:31:55,901
Only thing I gotta say is,

562
00:31:55,937 --> 00:31:58,654
there's a smart time to be scared, bro...

563
00:32:00,825 --> 00:32:02,825
And a stupid time.

564
00:32:08,499 --> 00:32:09,832
Shayla?

565
00:32:09,867 --> 00:32:11,283
The lock pick.

566
00:32:11,336 --> 00:32:12,868
Every hacker's favorite sport.

567
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:14,286
The perfect system to crack,

568
00:32:14,339 --> 00:32:16,288
mostly because unlike virtual systems,

569
00:32:16,341 --> 00:32:18,207
when you break it, you can feel it.

570
00:32:18,259 --> 00:32:19,675
You can see it. You can hear it.

571
00:32:26,134 --> 00:32:29,969
Shayla.

572
00:32:30,021 --> 00:32:31,437
Hey.

573
00:32:31,472 --> 00:32:32,972
Shayla.

574
00:32:33,024 --> 00:32:35,725
Wake up.

575
00:32:35,777 --> 00:32:38,477
Mm.

576
00:32:38,529 --> 00:32:41,113
What happened?

577
00:32:41,149 --> 00:32:44,200
You okay?

578
00:32:44,235 --> 00:32:46,369
Why was that asshole here?

579
00:32:46,404 --> 00:32:48,237
Why am I in the tub?

580
00:32:52,619 --> 00:32:55,588
I don't know, um... I told
him I needed your pills.

581
00:32:55,623 --> 00:32:59,892
He came over. We smoked a little.

582
00:33:00,727 --> 00:33:02,427
You remember having sex with him?

583
00:33:02,462 --> 00:33:05,864
What? No.

584
00:33:05,899 --> 00:33:07,465
But he definitely does.

585
00:33:07,501 --> 00:33:08,800
Okay, let's go.

586
00:33:08,835 --> 00:33:10,869
- Get your purse, make sure...
- Stop.

587
00:33:10,904 --> 00:33:14,472
I'm not going anywhere, okay?

588
00:33:14,508 --> 00:33:15,941
What do you mean?

589
00:33:15,976 --> 00:33:18,076
Oh, he's just gonna get away with it?

590
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:21,913
You can't go back to him.
Hey, I don't need the pills.

591
00:33:21,949 --> 00:33:24,950
- Just find someone else.
- I can't.

592
00:33:28,789 --> 00:33:32,657
He gives me a really
good deal on the split.

593
00:33:32,693 --> 00:33:34,492
I make good money.

594
00:33:34,528 --> 00:33:36,294
There it is again,

595
00:33:36,330 --> 00:33:38,296
the invisible hand at work, controlling us,

596
00:33:38,332 --> 00:33:41,299
even if it pushes us past
our threshold of pain.

597
00:33:41,335 --> 00:33:44,502
It's not gonna stop.

598
00:33:44,538 --> 00:33:46,471
What if he does it again?

599
00:33:46,506 --> 00:33:50,075
Promise me you won't do anything?

600
00:33:50,110 --> 00:33:52,077
I'm serious, Elliot.

601
00:33:52,112 --> 00:33:55,080
There's nothing to be done here.

602
00:33:55,115 --> 00:33:57,382
It's not like I have a choice.

603
00:33:59,219 --> 00:34:00,518
Hey...

604
00:34:00,554 --> 00:34:03,455
Would you mind sleeping here tonight?

605
00:34:08,061 --> 00:34:09,828
Choices.

606
00:34:09,863 --> 00:34:12,097
Maybe Mr. Robot's right.

607
00:34:12,132 --> 00:34:16,167
That's what this is all about,
the yesses and nos of life.

608
00:34:16,203 --> 00:34:19,871
But do we decide them or do they decide us?

609
00:34:19,906 --> 00:34:22,207
Fernando Vera. I get rid of him,

610
00:34:22,242 --> 00:34:24,376
I get rid of my drug dealer's supplier.

611
00:34:24,411 --> 00:34:26,177
I get rid of the morphine.

612
00:34:26,213 --> 00:34:29,647
And the pain I've been
holding in comes rushing out.

613
00:34:29,683 --> 00:34:31,483
Sure, I can try to find another dealer,

614
00:34:31,485 --> 00:34:34,519
but like Vera said, no one
on the streets deals Suboxone.

615
00:34:34,554 --> 00:34:36,955
I could go back to digitally
counterfeiting scripts,

616
00:34:36,990 --> 00:34:39,991
but pharmas spend a lot of
dough protecting their wares.

617
00:34:39,993 --> 00:34:42,327
Most places only take paper scripts.

618
00:34:42,379 --> 00:34:44,796
Continuously getting legit
refills isn't realistic,

619
00:34:44,831 --> 00:34:46,831
and neither is being a junkie.

620
00:34:46,883 --> 00:34:50,885
So I quit cold turkey or let Vera exist.

621
00:34:50,921 --> 00:34:53,838
I know what you're thinking.
The answer's too obvious.

622
00:34:53,890 --> 00:34:56,341
Vera may have been groping Shayla before,

623
00:34:56,393 --> 00:34:58,259
but he's graduated to rape.

624
00:35:01,932 --> 00:35:05,517
Just like Shayla, he's left me no choice.

625
00:35:05,519 --> 00:35:08,520
He can't be allowed to exist anymore.

626
00:35:20,534 --> 00:35:24,536
Perhaps we should start
with how you're feeling.

627
00:35:27,924 --> 00:35:30,708
Not good.

628
00:35:30,761 --> 00:35:34,679
What's not good right now?

629
00:35:34,714 --> 00:35:35,880
Everything.

630
00:35:37,884 --> 00:35:40,769
Humor me with some specifics.

631
00:35:45,442 --> 00:35:51,029
How do we know if we're in control?

632
00:35:51,064 --> 00:35:54,199
That we're not just making the best

633
00:35:54,234 --> 00:35:57,235
of what comes at us, and that's it.

634
00:35:57,287 --> 00:36:01,372
Trying to constantly
pick between two options.

635
00:36:01,408 --> 00:36:05,293
Like your two paintings
in the waiting room.

636
00:36:05,328 --> 00:36:09,747
Or... Coke and Pepsi.

637
00:36:09,749 --> 00:36:12,884
McDonald's or Burger King?

638
00:36:12,919 --> 00:36:17,889
Hyundai or Honda?

639
00:36:17,924 --> 00:36:20,925
Hmm.

640
00:36:20,927 --> 00:36:25,396
It's all part of the same blur, right?

641
00:36:25,432 --> 00:36:28,433
Just out of focus enough.

642
00:36:28,468 --> 00:36:30,969
It's the illusion of choice.

643
00:36:31,004 --> 00:36:34,172
Half of us can't even pick our own...

644
00:36:34,207 --> 00:36:37,575
our cable, gas, electric.

645
00:36:37,611 --> 00:36:41,996
The water we drink, our health insurance.

646
00:36:42,032 --> 00:36:45,283
Even if we did, would it matter?

647
00:36:45,285 --> 00:36:48,620
You know, if our only option
is Blue Cross or Blue Shield,

648
00:36:48,672 --> 00:36:51,589
what the fuck is the difference?

649
00:36:56,463 --> 00:37:01,099
In fact, aren't they...
aren't they the same?

650
00:37:01,134 --> 00:37:03,184
No, man...

651
00:37:03,220 --> 00:37:07,105
our choices are prepaid for us,

652
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:10,441
long time ago.

653
00:37:10,477 --> 00:37:13,478
I'm sorry you feel you have no control.

654
00:37:15,482 --> 00:37:20,985
Thought I was doing something good.

655
00:37:21,037 --> 00:37:25,456
I was a part of this... project.

656
00:37:25,492 --> 00:37:29,327
Thought I was going to be
a part of something special.

657
00:37:33,917 --> 00:37:38,670
- And now?
- Now...

658
00:37:38,722 --> 00:37:41,339
It turned out to be a mistake,

659
00:37:41,341 --> 00:37:43,725
like everything else.

660
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:48,646
What's the point, right?

661
00:37:48,682 --> 00:37:51,983
Might as well, just... you do nothing.

662
00:37:52,018 --> 00:37:55,653
Might as well do nothing.

663
00:37:55,689 --> 00:37:57,655
You've brought up this issue before,

664
00:37:57,691 --> 00:38:00,658
this issue of not feeling
like you're in control.

665
00:38:00,694 --> 00:38:02,694
Do you remember?

666
00:38:05,582 --> 00:38:08,366
When we spoke about your father.

667
00:38:08,368 --> 00:38:10,868
You talked about how he chose to do nothing

668
00:38:10,870 --> 00:38:13,538
when he was battling his cancer.

669
00:38:13,540 --> 00:38:15,089
You told him he could have

670
00:38:15,125 --> 00:38:16,674
fought the company that caused it.

671
00:38:16,710 --> 00:38:18,509
He could have told people about it.

672
00:38:18,545 --> 00:38:22,213
He could have sought better
care than what he was getting.

673
00:38:22,215 --> 00:38:26,050
Instead, he did nothing.

674
00:38:26,102 --> 00:38:31,022
Maybe your father felt
the same way as you do now.

675
00:38:31,057 --> 00:38:34,058
After all, like you said, what's the point?

676
00:38:34,110 --> 00:38:36,277
- It's different.
- What's different

677
00:38:36,313 --> 00:38:39,230
is you've found options, Elliot.

678
00:38:39,232 --> 00:38:42,734
That's the power you have.
That's the control you own.

679
00:38:42,736 --> 00:38:47,121
You don't have to just
take what life gives you.

680
00:38:47,157 --> 00:38:48,740
Come on.

681
00:38:48,792 --> 00:38:51,626
Tell me what is going on with you.

682
00:38:51,661 --> 00:38:54,245
I cannot help you if
you keep me in the dark.

683
00:38:54,297 --> 00:38:55,797
Shut up!

684
00:38:58,835 --> 00:39:00,335
Shut up!

685
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:05,089
You've got bags under your eyes.

686
00:39:05,091 --> 00:39:06,891
You're yelling. You're jittery.

687
00:39:06,926 --> 00:39:08,977
For the last month, I have seen you

688
00:39:09,012 --> 00:39:14,315
slip into old patterns, old behaviors.

689
00:39:14,351 --> 00:39:17,652
What is going on?

690
00:40:16,212 --> 00:40:17,995
He's still not answering.

691
00:40:17,997 --> 00:40:22,333
Well, we'll just have to ask him tomorrow.

692
00:40:22,385 --> 00:40:24,552
Every time I try to play it or rip it,

693
00:40:24,587 --> 00:40:28,005
it just freezes up my computer
and spits it back out again.

694
00:40:28,007 --> 00:40:31,059
He's not okay.

695
00:40:31,094 --> 00:40:34,178
He was acting so out of it at work today.

696
00:40:42,188 --> 00:40:43,404
Um...

697
00:40:44,891 --> 00:40:46,557
Are you saying something, babe?

698
00:40:46,593 --> 00:40:48,159
Something's wrong.

699
00:40:48,194 --> 00:40:49,744
Should I go over there?

700
00:40:49,779 --> 00:40:52,163
And just...

701
00:40:52,198 --> 00:40:54,198
Check in on him?

702
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:56,534
Uh... come on.

703
00:40:56,586 --> 00:40:59,504
That's ridiculous.

704
00:40:59,539 --> 00:41:01,089
You know he's always been a weirdo, right?

705
00:41:01,124 --> 00:41:05,760
I'm really worried about him.

706
00:41:05,795 --> 00:41:08,012
Um...

707
00:41:08,047 --> 00:41:10,431
My Arizona buddy Fred hit me up.

708
00:41:10,467 --> 00:41:13,384
He wants to grab a drink.

709
00:41:13,386 --> 00:41:15,636
Shouldn't take too long.

710
00:41:17,056 --> 00:41:18,272
Okay.

711
00:42:00,984 --> 00:42:03,277
_

712
00:42:07,542 --> 00:42:09,126
- Nice one, bro.
- Nice.

713
00:42:29,865 --> 00:42:33,066
"Deep passions, longing...

714
00:42:33,068 --> 00:42:35,652
The two of them had
never felt such a love,

715
00:42:35,704 --> 00:42:40,073
such closeness, such a connection."

716
00:42:40,625 --> 00:42:43,159
- Found a way to do it without...
- Shh!

717
00:42:43,211 --> 00:42:45,211
Sit down.

718
00:42:55,056 --> 00:42:56,422
I know how to take out the backups

719
00:42:56,424 --> 00:42:58,307
without blowing up the pipeline.

720
00:42:58,343 --> 00:43:00,176
You know, Elliot, I really
feel like we resolved

721
00:43:00,228 --> 00:43:02,762
this thing between us.
Didn't you walk away?

722
00:43:02,764 --> 00:43:04,430
- I did.
- Didn't I say

723
00:43:04,432 --> 00:43:06,015
that if you walked away,

724
00:43:06,067 --> 00:43:09,151
you were no longer a part of this?

725
00:43:09,187 --> 00:43:10,987
I have a real plan...

726
00:43:11,022 --> 00:43:12,398
If you want me to let you back in,

727
00:43:12,399 --> 00:43:14,765
there's an understanding
we have to come to,

728
00:43:14,810 --> 00:43:16,059
a debt you have to pay,

729
00:43:16,094 --> 00:43:18,011
because, remember, you walked away.

730
00:43:18,013 --> 00:43:19,596
I thought you didn't believe in debts.

731
00:43:19,648 --> 00:43:22,015
Not true. I believe in debts.

732
00:43:22,067 --> 00:43:24,434
I believe in erasing them.

733
00:43:28,774 --> 00:43:31,274
What do you want?

734
00:43:33,195 --> 00:43:36,029
I want you to tell me about your father.

735
00:43:36,031 --> 00:43:38,248
You're not gonna get into my head, man.

736
00:43:38,283 --> 00:43:40,367
Your David Koresh shit
isn't gonna work on me.

737
00:43:40,369 --> 00:43:42,535
Tell me how he died.

738
00:43:42,587 --> 00:43:44,037
Why, man? Something tells me

739
00:43:44,089 --> 00:43:46,206
you already looked that shit up anyway.

740
00:43:46,258 --> 00:43:48,675
I wanna hear it from you.

741
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:57,083
So I do this...

742
00:43:57,135 --> 00:43:58,801
we go back to the arcade,

743
00:43:58,837 --> 00:44:01,054
discuss the plan with the rest of them?

744
00:44:15,569 --> 00:44:18,904
I don't know what you want me to say.

745
00:44:18,906 --> 00:44:20,632
We were close. Very close.

746
00:44:20,633 --> 00:44:22,942
He was my best friend.

747
00:44:22,994 --> 00:44:26,779
Worked at Evil Corp his whole life.

748
00:44:26,781 --> 00:44:29,365
He was one of the best
computer engineers they had.

749
00:44:30,197 --> 00:44:31,934
And out of the blue, he got fired.

750
00:44:31,986 --> 00:44:34,437
No one knew why.

751
00:44:34,489 --> 00:44:37,239
Then one day he told me.

752
00:44:37,275 --> 00:44:40,276
He had leukemia.

753
00:44:40,328 --> 00:44:42,111
Made me swear to never tell anyone,

754
00:44:42,163 --> 00:44:45,114
especially my mom.

755
00:44:45,166 --> 00:44:46,449
So I didn't.

756
00:44:46,501 --> 00:44:48,617
A few months go by...

757
00:44:48,670 --> 00:44:51,203
he got sicker and sicker.

758
00:44:51,205 --> 00:44:55,291
Finally, I got so worried...

759
00:44:55,343 --> 00:44:57,460
told my mom.

760
00:44:57,512 --> 00:45:00,270
When he found out, he got pissed.

761
00:45:00,348 --> 00:45:02,715
Started yelling.

762
00:45:02,767 --> 00:45:06,886
I remember I tried to hug
him, tell him I'm sorry, and...

763
00:45:06,938 --> 00:45:09,389
kept shoving me away and shoved me so hard

764
00:45:09,441 --> 00:45:11,391
I fell backwards out the window.

765
00:45:11,393 --> 00:45:14,894
I fell, and I broke my arm.

766
00:45:14,946 --> 00:45:17,397
Never spoke to me after that.

767
00:45:17,749 --> 00:45:19,615
Couldn't even look at me.

768
00:45:19,667 --> 00:45:22,285
Even the night he died.

769
00:45:25,673 --> 00:45:29,509
We good?

770
00:45:41,940 --> 00:45:44,891
I understand what it's
like to lose a parent.

771
00:45:44,943 --> 00:45:47,143
It's heartbreaking.

772
00:45:50,148 --> 00:45:54,283
Did you ever think he was right?

773
00:45:54,319 --> 00:45:56,118
About what?

774
00:45:56,154 --> 00:45:58,654
Hurting you that day?

775
00:45:58,706 --> 00:46:00,623
For what you did to him?

776
00:46:00,658 --> 00:46:02,408
You ever think you deserved it?

777
00:46:02,460 --> 00:46:04,243
I didn't do anything to him.

778
00:46:04,245 --> 00:46:06,078
I was trying to help him.

779
00:46:06,080 --> 00:46:07,683
For betraying his trust.

780
00:46:07,684 --> 00:46:09,882
I was eight years ol...

781
00:46:15,139 --> 00:46:18,023
You didn't commit to the
sacred pact you'd formed.
