00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:07,651
Good.

7
00:01:15,284 --> 00:01:16,576
Why don't you take it?

8
00:01:16,577 --> 00:01:20,456
Bastards...

9
00:01:21,332 --> 00:01:22,750
Okay then!

10
00:01:23,417 --> 00:01:28,714
Hero of the Goboi plains!
Stand up, Kim Jin-pyong!

11
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:41,643
Bottoms up!
Pass it down.

12
00:01:41,644 --> 00:01:44,939
Bottoms up! Bottoms up!

13
00:01:46,357 --> 00:01:49,193
Commander,
I'm abstaining from alcohol.

14
00:01:49,276 --> 00:01:52,863
Abstaining? You fool!

15
00:01:56,617 --> 00:02:03,790
The late chief exchanged drinks with
every one of his men in this! Drink up!

16
00:02:03,791 --> 00:02:09,630
Bottoms up! Bottoms up!

17
00:02:10,798 --> 00:02:12,299
Good!

18
00:02:13,342 --> 00:02:14,426
There you go!

19
00:02:14,635 --> 00:02:15,302
Good, good!

20
00:02:17,471 --> 00:02:20,141
Turn it over!

Producer KIM Dae-woo, PARK Dae-hee

22
00:03:09,315 --> 00:03:14,861
Fuck, I'm sick
and tired of Goboi Plains.

23
00:03:14,862 --> 00:03:15,988
What again?

24
00:03:17,031 --> 00:03:20,284
Always sticking up
for his son-in-law.

25
00:03:21,869 --> 00:03:25,497
Shit, everybody's brave
when you're about to fuckin' die.

26
00:03:27,208 --> 00:03:29,543
But you've never
even been in battle.

27
00:03:30,294 --> 00:03:34,506
He's at the top of the line
and he's the best.

28
00:03:36,175 --> 00:03:39,637
Well, yeah... Hey! What
are you doing out?

29
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,388
- What?
- Get back in.

30
00:03:41,889 --> 00:03:44,266
- Okay, we're going.
- Hurry back in!

31
00:03:44,558 --> 00:03:45,851
We're going.

32
00:03:50,356 --> 00:03:56,695
By the way, I heard something
about Kim Jin-pyong...

33
00:03:57,696 --> 00:03:59,406
You can't tell this to anyone.

34
00:03:59,865 --> 00:04:02,867
I won't. Just spill it.

35
00:04:02,868 --> 00:04:07,915
- No, you're a big mouth.
- Hey, that's not true.

OBSESSED

41
00:05:19,445 --> 00:05:22,323
We were in Vietnam
during the same period.

42
00:05:22,364 --> 00:05:25,826
That's right.
Colonel, you're my idol.

43
00:05:26,535 --> 00:05:28,077
We must've met at least once.

44
00:05:28,078 --> 00:05:32,708
That's impossible
'cause he had the easy assignments.

45
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:35,586
Do you know Captain Kyung?

46
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:39,840
I've heard of him,
he was very famous.

47
00:05:40,674 --> 00:05:42,551
Weren't you Commodore Park's galloper?

48
00:05:44,511 --> 00:05:45,554
Yes, sir.

49
00:05:46,847 --> 00:05:50,975
One day,
Commodore Park complained,

50
00:05:50,976 --> 00:05:58,650
"I hate sticky weather!"
So Captain Kyung brought in a heater.

51
00:05:59,777 --> 00:06:02,571
A heater?
In Vietnam?

52
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:11,872
Imagine how many air conditioners
they must've needed.

53
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:15,209
- Three large ones, right?
- Yes, sir.

54
00:06:16,377 --> 00:06:19,713
Commodore Park spoke highly of
this friend wherever he went.

55
00:06:21,382 --> 00:06:23,801
You sure are clever.

56
00:06:23,967 --> 00:06:26,095
Not really...

57
00:06:26,804 --> 00:06:29,138
You're from Busan, but have no accent.

58
00:06:29,139 --> 00:06:31,517
I've never had one since childhood.

59
00:06:34,645 --> 00:06:38,899
Your wife's name is unique.
Jong Ga-heun...

60
00:06:39,191 --> 00:06:43,403
- I've never heard of the surname Jong.
- She's Chinese.

61
00:06:43,404 --> 00:06:45,531
Both of her parents are.

62
00:06:46,573 --> 00:06:50,411
There's also something interesting.
Haven't you noticed it yet?

63
00:06:57,668 --> 00:07:03,424
My wife's birthday and yours
are on the same date September 20.

64
00:07:04,299 --> 00:07:05,801
Isn't that interesting?

65
00:07:12,182 --> 00:07:17,813
We shouldn't just gather for gossip.
We're not living in the old days.

66
00:07:17,938 --> 00:07:25,529
We should do something meaningful.
Be more helpful to our husbands, right?

67
00:07:26,321 --> 00:07:27,448
Dinner's ready.

68
00:07:28,782 --> 00:07:29,741
Hurry UP-

69
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:38,583
Lieutenant Colonel Choi's wife came up
with the group's name.

70
00:07:38,584 --> 00:07:40,711
She's brilliant.

71
00:07:41,587 --> 00:07:44,965
- Yeah?
- Don't you want to know?

72
00:07:46,675 --> 00:07:47,718
What is it?

73
00:07:49,052 --> 00:07:52,306
The Nightingales!
Isn't it just grand?

74
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:57,686
Give us a speech for the inauguration
at the hospital 2 days later.

75
00:08:00,522 --> 00:08:01,607
Do I have to go?

76
00:08:01,648 --> 00:08:07,488
You must.
Your support gives us authority.

77
00:08:08,363 --> 00:08:11,574
The Korea Defense Daily
is doing a report

78
00:08:11,575 --> 00:08:13,327
so you have to be in the photo.

79
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:15,996
I'm doing this for you.

80
00:08:28,175 --> 00:08:29,718
What are the circles for?

81
00:08:31,053 --> 00:08:32,012
Oh, that?

82
00:08:32,846 --> 00:08:35,682
The doctor told me
When I will ovulate.

83
00:08:36,642 --> 00:08:40,604
Oh my, what day is it today?

84
00:08:43,106 --> 00:08:45,526
Oh my...

85
00:08:47,361 --> 00:08:49,321
Wow...

86
00:08:55,244 --> 00:08:56,036
Good...

87
00:08:57,746 --> 00:08:58,705
I love it...

88
00:09:06,296 --> 00:09:11,426
You were great!

89
00:09:12,219 --> 00:09:15,472
You get better and better.

90
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:19,893
I was so feeling it today.

91
00:09:28,235 --> 00:09:32,155
- How long do you have to stay like that?
- About an hour.

92
00:09:33,699 --> 00:09:37,953
The new sergeant couple
moved into our front house.

93
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:43,584
The captain seemed so happy
to be near us.

94
00:09:44,501 --> 00:09:46,461
He really seems to admire you.

95
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:48,922
Really?

96
00:09:49,923 --> 00:09:51,967
The wife is Chinese.

97
00:09:53,468 --> 00:09:57,598
- They're also childless.
- I noticed from his papers.

98
00:09:59,933 --> 00:10:02,644
We were the only childless couple
in this residence.

99
00:10:03,937 --> 00:10:05,772
Maybe that's why I like her.

100
00:10:10,277 --> 00:10:11,236
You like her?

101
00:10:13,405 --> 00:10:18,118
She seems shy and
a bit uneasy around people.

102
00:10:19,786 --> 00:10:23,999
But she must love birds,
having so many bird cages.

103
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:27,169
Chinese people like birds.

104
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:31,214
Oh no... This is all wrong.

105
00:12:21,533 --> 00:12:23,160
The bird doesn't like that.

106
00:12:32,502 --> 00:12:33,462
I apologize.

107
00:12:42,095 --> 00:12:43,346
Do birds annoy you?

108
00:12:44,973 --> 00:12:48,643
No, it was just for fun.

109
00:12:50,937 --> 00:12:52,147
I'm sorry.

110
00:12:54,941 --> 00:12:58,653
It's okay,
if you don't hate them.

111
00:13:09,873 --> 00:13:12,834
Do you live in the residence?

112
00:13:15,253 --> 00:13:16,004
Yes.

113
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:40,403
Tinnitus, insomnia,
panic disorder...

114
00:13:42,572 --> 00:13:47,285
Panic disorder is serious,
but with some effort it's curable.

115
00:13:49,871 --> 00:13:51,331
However delirium...

116
00:13:54,501 --> 00:13:56,378
Seeing the Vietcong is
a symptom of delirium

117
00:13:58,338 --> 00:13:59,923
and this is even more serious.

118
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:05,220
It happens only once in a while.

119
00:14:05,971 --> 00:14:06,847
Still...

120
00:14:11,393 --> 00:14:13,311
What kind of dreams
do you dream?

121
00:14:14,521 --> 00:14:15,522
My dreams?

122
00:14:27,492 --> 00:14:32,497
<i>In my dreams, I'm always
at that jungle.</i>

123
00:14:39,296 --> 00:14:43,508
<i>So strange
since I don't feel any guilt.</i>

124
00:15:06,907 --> 00:15:07,908
What about alcohol?

125
00:15:10,911 --> 00:15:13,162
With all of your nagging I stopped.

126
00:15:13,163 --> 00:15:14,915
When I do drink, I throw it all up.

127
00:15:21,796 --> 00:15:23,423
Alcohol is strictly prohibited.

128
00:15:25,091 --> 00:15:28,637
- Got it? I said never.
- Okay, got it.

129
00:15:29,179 --> 00:15:31,139
- See ya.
- I said never.

130
00:15:38,104 --> 00:15:39,397
Did you tell anyone...

131
00:15:41,274 --> 00:15:42,442
about me?

132
00:15:46,029 --> 00:15:46,780
No.

133
00:15:48,865 --> 00:15:49,741
I'm sorry.

134
00:15:57,624 --> 00:16:02,796
<i>Diagnosis - Influenza</i>

135
00:16:06,299 --> 00:16:08,927
You darling, stay there
and you love, move down.

136
00:16:10,095 --> 00:16:12,889
You two...
Yes, switch places.

137
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:22,524
- Can I stand behind the colonel?
- Stop talking and just move.

138
00:16:23,817 --> 00:16:24,484
Let's see.

139
00:16:24,776 --> 00:16:29,489
- I think we're good now.
- No, the first line has to be presentable.

140
00:16:31,157 --> 00:16:31,992
Now we're done.

141
00:16:35,161 --> 00:16:37,914
Who's that?

142
00:16:38,957 --> 00:16:43,294
I thought you couldn't come.
Come on over!

143
00:16:45,296 --> 00:16:47,841
The wife of the new sergeant
Captain Kyung Woo-jin.

144
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:49,843
Your name was Ga-heun, right?

145
00:16:51,177 --> 00:16:52,511
This is...

146
00:16:52,512 --> 00:16:54,180
the wife of Lieutenant Colonel Choi.

147
00:16:54,723 --> 00:16:59,394
Jacqueline Kennedy is here.
- It was tailored in a hurry.

148
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:02,313
She's even humble.

149
00:17:02,939 --> 00:17:06,901
After a month of preparations,
we still look like country-girls.

150
00:17:08,403 --> 00:17:10,696
Excessive humility is arrogance.

151
00:17:10,697 --> 00:17:11,448
Enough.

152
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:15,035
My husband,

153
00:17:15,535 --> 00:17:18,288
Colonel Kim Jin-pyong

154
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:24,460
- Darling, you go up.
- Me?

155
00:17:24,461 --> 00:17:25,462
And Ga-heun...

156
00:17:27,422 --> 00:17:28,298
Let's see.

157
00:17:30,008 --> 00:17:30,842
Good!

158
00:17:34,304 --> 00:17:35,180
Tilt it 15 degrees.

159
00:17:48,068 --> 00:17:50,028
It's like we're nurses.

160
00:17:50,695 --> 00:17:53,323
Madam, you're like the head nurse.

161
00:17:59,162 --> 00:18:01,247
Settle down.

162
00:18:02,499 --> 00:18:04,060
Don't make a fuss.
It's just a hospital.

163
00:18:05,335 --> 00:18:06,544
Please do something.

164
00:18:11,424 --> 00:18:14,135
Stop crying.
Did somebody die?

165
00:18:16,721 --> 00:18:18,139
Kimchi?

166
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:25,230
I thought he was fasting.
Great going...

167
00:18:25,605 --> 00:18:28,274
Let's take a picture!

168
00:18:31,194 --> 00:18:33,780
My husband is upset.

169
00:18:34,739 --> 00:18:37,200
Nobody paid attention to his advice.

170
00:18:38,535 --> 00:18:40,995
His voice was too small.

171
00:18:41,621 --> 00:18:45,750
Can I ask a personal question?

172
00:18:47,293 --> 00:18:50,380
Why I don't have a child?

173
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:56,094
I also hate that question,
but I'm curious.

174
00:18:56,803 --> 00:19:00,181
Well, I'm just...
still not pregnant.

175
00:19:01,975 --> 00:19:04,310
I thought you weren't
having one on purpose.

176
00:19:04,769 --> 00:19:06,009
Following the American-style...

177
00:19:08,523 --> 00:19:09,816
Let's be friends.

178
00:19:11,818 --> 00:19:15,655
You're just
too gentle and kind.

179
00:19:18,324 --> 00:19:21,161
The wives here
are a bit aggressive.

180
00:19:23,371 --> 00:19:24,914
Yes?

181
00:19:25,331 --> 00:19:26,457
I'm sorry...

182
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:31,546
I just wanted to say
how encouraging your visit is.

183
00:19:31,671 --> 00:19:33,506
It's my pleasure.

184
00:19:34,007 --> 00:19:38,011
Such a handsome man...
It's a pity that your leg is...

185
00:19:38,303 --> 00:19:40,013
Well, I can't do anything about it.

186
00:19:40,805 --> 00:19:46,852
What's amazing is it still itches
like I have a leg.

187
00:19:46,853 --> 00:19:50,189
That's called phantom pain, right?

188
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:52,692
Wow, you're well-informed.

189
00:19:53,067 --> 00:19:56,654
Could you help me up?

190
00:19:56,946 --> 00:19:58,615
Of course.

191
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:03,745
Slowly... slowly...

192
00:20:07,665 --> 00:20:11,461
Fucking Vietcong!
I'll kill you all!

193
00:20:16,841 --> 00:20:18,718
What are you doing?

194
00:20:19,219 --> 00:20:21,012
Put the knife down, now!

195
00:20:21,971 --> 00:20:24,264
Put it down and talk with me.

196
00:20:24,265 --> 00:20:28,394
Fuck!
Send me to Korea.

197
00:20:28,478 --> 00:20:32,397
This is Korea.
Let her go.

198
00:20:32,398 --> 00:20:35,276
Vietcong's there...
Vietcong...

199
00:20:37,487 --> 00:20:40,740
There aren't any Vietcong here.
We're in Korea.

200
00:20:41,115 --> 00:20:42,575
Vietcong, Vietcong!

201
00:20:44,035 --> 00:20:45,118
You son of a bitch.

202
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:46,037
Let her go.

203
00:20:46,537 --> 00:20:49,165
Send me to Korea,
you son of a bitch!

204
00:20:49,249 --> 00:20:51,918
This is my last warning.
Let her go.

205
00:20:52,418 --> 00:20:54,671
Vietcong! Vietcong!

206
00:20:56,297 --> 00:20:57,507
I'm okay.

207
00:20:59,092 --> 00:21:00,218
Don't shoot.

208
00:21:01,886 --> 00:21:05,640
Vietcong's over there.
Shit, you're lying!

209
00:21:08,643 --> 00:21:11,520
We're in Korea.
There are no Vietcong.

210
00:21:11,521 --> 00:21:14,732
See, I'm putting my gun down.

211
00:21:16,109 --> 00:21:18,778
The Vietcong are
here again to beat me.

212
00:21:20,863 --> 00:21:21,781
Don't worry.

213
00:21:22,991 --> 00:21:25,618
I'll take you to Korea.
Don't worry.

214
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:31,291
Madame!

215
00:21:31,833 --> 00:21:34,168
It's no use.
I don't have a leg.

216
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:37,005
- Calm down...
- You abandoned me.

217
00:21:37,255 --> 00:21:39,465
- Calm down...
- You left me there.

218
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:40,425
Calm down...

219
00:22:08,328 --> 00:22:09,162
What are you doing!

220
00:22:12,332 --> 00:22:13,833
Vietcong! Vietcong!

221
00:22:15,376 --> 00:22:16,127
Are you okay?

222
00:22:17,128 --> 00:22:18,838
Doctor! Doctor!

223
00:22:20,506 --> 00:22:21,341
Are you okay?

224
00:22:26,846 --> 00:22:30,516
I think I lost my earring.

225
00:22:31,684 --> 00:22:33,019
Where did it go?

226
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:47,617
<i>She sure is something.</i>

227
00:22:48,076 --> 00:22:51,328
<i>She didn't seem to care about
the blood on her neck.</i>

228
00:22:51,329 --> 00:22:55,375
<i>I know!
I felt the same way.</i>

229
00:22:55,625 --> 00:23:00,171
'Don't shoot, I'm okay.'
Did you hear that bullshit?

230
00:23:01,005 --> 00:23:03,925
Really?
Who does she think she is?

231
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:07,345
- Putting the Colonel in trouble...
- Goddamnit!

232
00:23:07,387 --> 00:23:11,641
Acting calm and all...

233
00:23:12,308 --> 00:23:15,727
Did you see how she just
nodded to greet me?

234
00:23:15,728 --> 00:23:19,106
I was shocked
but I didn't say a word

235
00:23:19,107 --> 00:23:20,358
because of the occasion.

236
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:23,528
- I'm not going to do her hair.
- Don't!

237
00:23:23,903 --> 00:23:25,947
I think it's because
she's a Chinese bitch.

238
00:23:26,572 --> 00:23:31,411
You know the rude waiters
in Chinese restaurants...

239
00:23:31,452 --> 00:23:35,623
You're right!
You're so sharp!

240
00:23:36,082 --> 00:23:38,584
Anyway, she's in trouble now.

241
00:23:39,085 --> 00:23:42,088
I'll be watching her.

242
00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:48,886
'I think I lost my earring?'
I can't believe it.

243
00:23:50,346 --> 00:23:51,264
How dare you.

244
00:23:51,931 --> 00:23:53,224
You bastard.

245
00:24:01,941 --> 00:24:03,943
Crazy asshole.

246
00:24:04,569 --> 00:24:05,278
Alright, alright.

247
00:24:10,616 --> 00:24:11,951
What is all this?

248
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:18,958
Sir!

249
00:24:22,712 --> 00:24:23,880
Are you aware that

250
00:24:24,922 --> 00:24:26,591
he's a patient?

251
00:24:28,718 --> 00:24:31,345
Just making sure he's real.

252
00:24:34,098 --> 00:24:37,852
You know you can tell things
if you beat someone up good.

253
00:24:38,978 --> 00:24:40,021
So?

254
00:24:41,898 --> 00:24:43,232
Is he a fake?

255
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:45,443
I'm not sure.

256
00:24:48,237 --> 00:24:49,489
But more importantly,

257
00:24:50,490 --> 00:24:54,285
I was mad about troubling you.

258
00:24:55,036 --> 00:24:56,996
It'll never happen again, sir!

259
00:25:02,001 --> 00:25:03,419
Well, anyway...

260
00:25:05,922 --> 00:25:07,381
It was my fault too,

261
00:25:09,509 --> 00:25:12,553
So I'd like to apologize
To your wife in person...

262
00:25:14,096 --> 00:25:16,849
As you wish, sir.

263
00:25:19,185 --> 00:25:22,480
<i>I don't need medicine.
Why are you here?</i>

264
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:27,568
<i>Can't a mother visit
a daughter shot by a gun?</i>

265
00:25:28,069 --> 00:25:31,822
<i>Who's my mother?
I hate hearing you say that.</i>

266
00:25:45,586 --> 00:25:49,215
- Who could this be?
- What do you care?

267
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:53,594
<i>I don't want to see you again.</i>

268
00:25:53,886 --> 00:25:54,971
<i>Got it?</i>

269
00:25:56,681 --> 00:25:57,515
<i>Okay.</i>

270
00:26:01,394 --> 00:26:04,897
<i>But eat the medicine.
I'm going.</i>

271
00:26:09,569 --> 00:26:14,031
See you again, dandy officer.

272
00:26:35,845 --> 00:26:37,805
You were wounded because of me.

273
00:26:39,098 --> 00:26:41,475
I came to apologize
and see how you were.

274
00:26:45,771 --> 00:26:47,273
The flowers are very pretty.

275
00:26:50,693 --> 00:26:52,445
I'm not familiar with flowers...

276
00:26:54,572 --> 00:26:55,615
If they're left like that

277
00:26:57,950 --> 00:26:59,869
the flowers will wither.

278
00:27:01,537 --> 00:27:03,039
<i>Hospital Administration</i>

279
00:27:07,043 --> 00:27:09,962
Do you...

280
00:27:10,463 --> 00:27:12,840
have a vase or something?

281
00:27:30,650 --> 00:27:31,359
Colonel Kim.

282
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:33,069
What's that?

283
00:27:34,028 --> 00:27:35,029
Nothing.

284
00:27:39,825 --> 00:27:40,743
Colonel Kim!

285
00:27:45,706 --> 00:27:48,668
How did you know
I wanted to eat some cake?

286
00:28:06,894 --> 00:28:08,020
By the way...

287
00:28:10,523 --> 00:28:17,071
When you snatched away his knife,
he said something in Vietnamese.

288
00:28:19,198 --> 00:28:21,200
What was it?

289
00:28:22,785 --> 00:28:24,370
Oh, that?

290
00:28:28,457 --> 00:28:30,251
He asked me to save him.

291
00:28:30,876 --> 00:28:34,797
He must have been tortured
by the Vietcong.

292
00:28:39,719 --> 00:28:41,512
What did you say to him?

293
00:28:42,221 --> 00:28:43,681
I said it was all over

294
00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:46,892
and not to worry.

295
00:28:51,397 --> 00:28:51,897
Here...

296
00:28:56,485 --> 00:29:00,698
- What is it?
- What you lost then...

297
00:29:03,159 --> 00:29:04,744
I thought
I would never find it.

298
00:29:11,876 --> 00:29:13,210
Can you put it on for me?

299
00:29:14,795 --> 00:29:15,755
What?

300
00:29:21,677 --> 00:29:22,762
Okay.

301
00:29:26,182 --> 00:29:28,267
I'm bossing you around
too much today.

302
00:29:46,285 --> 00:29:51,749
When you pointed your gun
and told him to let go

303
00:29:53,501 --> 00:29:55,294
you were so amazing.

304
00:30:26,909 --> 00:30:27,660
Oh...

305
00:30:28,077 --> 00:30:30,913
Do you still go to
that music room in town?

306
00:30:31,956 --> 00:30:32,832
What?

307
00:30:33,791 --> 00:30:35,501
What's on your mind?

308
00:30:36,210 --> 00:30:37,670
Any worries?

309
00:30:38,045 --> 00:30:39,630
It's nothing.

310
00:30:40,339 --> 00:30:42,423
What were you saying?

311
00:30:42,424 --> 00:30:47,720
The owner of the music room
was caught by the military police.

312
00:30:47,721 --> 00:30:49,181
You know him, right?

313
00:30:50,099 --> 00:30:52,852
<i>Turns out he's a sly man.</i>

314
00:30:53,143 --> 00:30:57,106
<i>Giving dance lessons
to housewives on Monday mornings.</i>

315
00:30:58,899 --> 00:31:01,610
Informed by intelligence,
we raided the place

316
00:31:02,862 --> 00:31:05,072
and found over ten women.

317
00:31:06,156 --> 00:31:09,076
They ran away screaming like shit.

318
00:31:09,493 --> 00:31:11,704
This guy is as strong as Hercules.

319
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:14,831
He blocked three of us.

320
00:31:14,832 --> 00:31:17,542
We fuckin' lost all of them.
Son of a bitch!

321
00:31:17,543 --> 00:31:18,878
Officer Kim.

322
00:31:21,046 --> 00:31:24,049
Let's ask a favor.

323
00:31:25,301 --> 00:31:30,889
As a regular, I know him
and it's his first time.

324
00:31:30,890 --> 00:31:32,057
Let him off the hook.

325
00:31:32,558 --> 00:31:34,268
What? No.

326
00:31:34,935 --> 00:31:37,646
There were officer wives
in the group.

327
00:31:39,064 --> 00:31:41,108
But this son of a bitch
won't say a word.

328
00:31:43,861 --> 00:31:47,823
Not beaten enough?

329
00:31:47,865 --> 00:31:49,408
He fought in Vietnam

330
00:31:50,409 --> 00:31:52,244
and served as a master sergeant.

331
00:31:57,583 --> 00:31:58,584
Really?

332
00:31:59,668 --> 00:32:01,921
You're just saying that
to get him out.

333
00:32:07,885 --> 00:32:09,136
You were a noncom?

334
00:32:12,222 --> 00:32:13,807
You must be my senior.

335
00:32:18,854 --> 00:32:20,898
You should be ashamed.

336
00:32:21,732 --> 00:32:25,861
A search troop sergeant
dancing with housewives...

337
00:32:27,446 --> 00:32:29,366
There's the colonel's plea,
and you're my senior.

338
00:32:34,787 --> 00:32:36,956
Let's not meet again
for the same reason.

339
00:32:39,625 --> 00:32:40,501
You're free to go.

340
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,882
As a regular customer,

341
00:32:46,966 --> 00:32:49,301
you must have had
a few dances, Colonel.

342
00:33:03,565 --> 00:33:06,986
- Watch your tongue.
- Yes, sir.

343
00:33:22,584 --> 00:33:24,003
Beer tastes best in the summer.

344
00:33:27,381 --> 00:33:28,382
Were you beaten a lot?

345
00:33:28,924 --> 00:33:31,677
A man is bound to get beaten
outside his home.

346
00:33:32,678 --> 00:33:34,263
What's with the vocal music?

347
00:33:37,683 --> 00:33:39,768
It's just I'm into such music
these clays.

348
00:33:42,521 --> 00:33:43,939
By the way, the housewives...

349
00:33:45,232 --> 00:33:47,860
Why dance on a Monday morning?

350
00:33:49,695 --> 00:33:50,779
Monday...

351
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:53,531
Because it's a Monday morning.

352
00:33:53,532 --> 00:33:55,993
Monday is a new beginning
for everybody.

353
00:33:56,326 --> 00:34:00,371
Husbands go to work,
children to school.

354
00:34:00,372 --> 00:34:02,875
But think of the housewives.

355
00:34:04,043 --> 00:34:05,836
Monday is just another day for them.

356
00:34:06,879 --> 00:34:10,215
They feel lonely and abandoned.

357
00:34:10,674 --> 00:34:13,886
That's when they go
to the beauty salon.

358
00:34:15,304 --> 00:34:18,807
They do their hair, dress up

359
00:34:19,725 --> 00:34:21,060
and gather here.

360
00:34:22,394 --> 00:34:23,437
And...

361
00:34:29,234 --> 00:34:30,486
They dance.

362
00:34:31,779 --> 00:34:33,197
It's the waltz.

363
00:34:35,949 --> 00:34:37,826
They forget everything.

364
00:34:40,454 --> 00:34:42,372
They submit themselves
to the men's lead.

365
00:34:45,292 --> 00:34:46,710
And flow to the music.

366
00:34:50,339 --> 00:34:54,301
Their body will sweat
and become hot.

367
00:34:56,845 --> 00:35:00,224
Alcohol and
a touch from a stranger

368
00:35:02,392 --> 00:35:04,228
make them go crazy.

369
00:35:05,187 --> 00:35:07,064
On a lonely Monday morning,

370
00:35:07,439 --> 00:35:12,611
she comes here for herself.
Only for herself!

371
00:35:17,324 --> 00:35:19,618
What am I doing
in front of you...

372
00:35:24,123 --> 00:35:27,626
I didn't know
you had such talent.

373
00:35:30,796 --> 00:35:34,091
I've just started learning.
Why don't you drink?

374
00:35:44,143 --> 00:35:47,146
Captain Kyung is amazing.

375
00:35:47,729 --> 00:35:49,523
He knows exactly what we like.

376
00:35:50,274 --> 00:35:56,613
He gave make-up to the other wives.
Lancome, Chanel... so generous...

377
00:36:23,974 --> 00:36:25,684
What are you thinking about?

378
00:36:29,521 --> 00:36:31,440
Nothing.

379
00:36:32,191 --> 00:36:33,552
You don't want to
go to the picnic?

380
00:36:35,861 --> 00:36:38,530
I was thinking about
something else.

381
00:36:43,702 --> 00:36:44,828
How do I look?

382
00:36:49,917 --> 00:36:53,045
Good, you look like
a French woman.

383
00:36:55,672 --> 00:36:56,840
Hurry up and get ready.

384
00:36:58,175 --> 00:37:00,135
Smoking again...

385
00:37:01,303 --> 00:37:02,721
Goodness...

386
00:37:10,812 --> 00:37:14,608
When did you prepare
all of this?

387
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:18,237
Even sandwiches!
Let's try.

388
00:37:19,905 --> 00:37:21,365
Yummy spam...

389
00:37:22,866 --> 00:37:27,079
- Honey, try this sandwich.
- I ate too much fruit.

390
00:37:29,456 --> 00:37:32,584
What did you do in Vietnam,
Captain Kyung?

391
00:37:32,793 --> 00:37:34,503
I'm a sham.

392
00:37:35,170 --> 00:37:40,050
I kissed up to senior officers
and had it easy.

393
00:37:40,467 --> 00:37:45,180
I see...
You had it easy.

394
00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:52,020
Colonel Kim was a legend
back then.

395
00:37:53,605 --> 00:37:57,025
All we talked about
was Colonel Kim.

396
00:37:57,985 --> 00:37:59,069
Like what?

397
00:37:59,778 --> 00:38:04,449
Like when his battalion
was besieged.

398
00:38:04,491 --> 00:38:08,704
He was the last one to escape
on a helicopter.

399
00:38:09,371 --> 00:38:15,668
A Vietcong division
shot the helicopter.

400
00:38:15,669 --> 00:38:16,377
Have some...

401
00:38:16,378 --> 00:38:19,839
It didn't go down but
most of the soldiers were killed.

402
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:22,384
- That's enough. Have a drink.
- Yes, sir.

403
00:38:30,017 --> 00:38:33,395
His search battalion
was really famous.

404
00:38:33,812 --> 00:38:37,816
Even their tattoos made
the Vietcong shake with fear.

405
00:38:38,525 --> 00:38:44,155
They pulled out the guts of the
Vietcong and hung them on trees...

406
00:38:44,156 --> 00:38:45,282
Enough!

407
00:38:53,165 --> 00:38:56,209
The Vietcong did those things first.

408
00:38:58,003 --> 00:38:59,588
We didn't start it.

409
00:39:00,005 --> 00:39:00,922
We just...

410
00:39:03,925 --> 00:39:05,093
returned what they did to us.

411
00:39:08,305 --> 00:39:10,182
I'll get more beer from the car.

412
00:39:11,058 --> 00:39:15,896
I need to go to the toilet.
Honey, excuse me.

413
00:39:18,857 --> 00:39:21,860
- My legs hurt.
- Want a piggyback?

414
00:39:22,361 --> 00:39:23,945
You are so naughty.

415
00:39:35,374 --> 00:39:37,084
I guess it was a bit gross.

416
00:39:37,959 --> 00:39:39,378
I hope you weren't offended.

417
00:39:41,171 --> 00:39:43,256
They started it.

418
00:39:51,390 --> 00:39:52,682
Have some more.

419
00:39:53,558 --> 00:39:57,854
Peaches are good for smokers.

420
00:40:01,691 --> 00:40:02,609
Okay.

421
00:40:18,125 --> 00:40:19,876
I was wondering...

422
00:40:21,795 --> 00:40:24,965
- if you could dance the waltz?
- What?

423
00:40:27,843 --> 00:40:29,761
I learned it in school once.

424
00:40:30,887 --> 00:40:31,721
Why?

425
00:40:34,391 --> 00:40:38,603
Just curious...
It was a stupid question.

426
00:40:41,773 --> 00:40:45,819
I also have a stupid thing
to tell you.

427
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:56,955
You came to visit me
at the hospital with flowers.

428
00:41:00,125 --> 00:41:07,299
I keep thinking of it.
I guess I enjoyed your visit.

429
00:41:08,633 --> 00:41:11,178
I enjoyed the canned cake.

430
00:41:12,137 --> 00:41:17,559
Even the silly flower arrangement
was nice.

431
00:41:20,187 --> 00:41:24,149
I keep smiling
thinking about it.

432
00:41:25,942 --> 00:41:27,819
I must sound quite silly.

433
00:41:39,039 --> 00:41:41,166
All day long...

434
00:41:43,793 --> 00:41:45,754
I think about you
all clay long.

435
00:41:46,963 --> 00:41:48,340
All day...

436
00:41:55,096 --> 00:41:57,849
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't be saying this...

437
00:42:08,777 --> 00:42:12,572
- Is this the tattoo he mentioned?
- Yes.

438
00:42:15,659 --> 00:42:17,035
It's very pretty.

439
00:42:21,248 --> 00:42:22,958
- Do you want it?
- What?

440
00:44:21,368 --> 00:44:23,453
It's not that I know it well.

441
00:44:25,664 --> 00:44:27,707
In Vietnam,

442
00:44:29,584 --> 00:44:31,878
the American soldiers had
small radios.

443
00:44:33,213 --> 00:44:37,926
The music coming out of them
sounded good.

444
00:44:39,344 --> 00:44:41,763
I didn't understand
why people listened to it before.

445
00:44:43,807 --> 00:44:48,561
Appreciating classical music
is your hobby then.

446
00:44:51,648 --> 00:44:53,358
I wouldn't say I appreciate it.

447
00:44:55,151 --> 00:45:02,659
Why listen to music from
a record player that isn't even hi-fi?

448
00:45:03,034 --> 00:45:08,289
A music hall should at least have
Tannoy and Mcln.

449
00:45:11,793 --> 00:45:13,253
What's Mcln?

450
00:45:15,547 --> 00:45:17,257
I mean, Mclntosh.

451
00:45:25,849 --> 00:45:27,892
What's your hobby?

452
00:45:29,853 --> 00:45:31,479
Not having one is my hobby.

453
00:45:35,775 --> 00:45:36,776
What about your wife?

454
00:45:38,903 --> 00:45:40,530
My wife's hobby...

455
00:45:42,198 --> 00:45:46,286
She tends after birds.
I hate birds.

456
00:45:50,832 --> 00:45:52,667
The sound quality is terrible.

457
00:45:54,085 --> 00:45:59,591
Captain Kyung, I didn't know
you listened to music here.

458
00:45:59,632 --> 00:46:06,431
I'm with my training sergeant
at his favorite place.

459
00:46:08,516 --> 00:46:09,893
Commander...

460
00:46:10,393 --> 00:46:12,020
Don't you remember me?

461
00:46:18,610 --> 00:46:20,487
- Haksu!
- Commander!

462
00:46:22,155 --> 00:46:23,197
I missed you.

463
00:46:23,198 --> 00:46:27,201
It's been a long time.
What have you been up to?

464
00:46:27,202 --> 00:46:29,913
Just the same old stuff.

465
00:46:31,247 --> 00:46:33,124
Didn't he mention me?

466
00:46:34,751 --> 00:46:35,710
No.

467
00:46:37,295 --> 00:46:41,382
I was about to visit you tonight.
But here you are.

468
00:46:44,302 --> 00:46:47,806
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.

469
00:46:51,267 --> 00:46:54,354
- Why didn't you tell me about Haksu?
- That's strange.

470
00:46:55,271 --> 00:46:58,858
You didn't know he was back?
I thought I told you.

471
00:46:59,943 --> 00:47:01,319
You didn't...

472
00:47:05,573 --> 00:47:08,618
You have the body of
a Western actress.

473
00:47:09,661 --> 00:47:11,454
Slender

474
00:47:12,288 --> 00:47:15,041
with a tiny waist

475
00:47:15,583 --> 00:47:18,086
and plump buttocks.

476
00:47:19,420 --> 00:47:25,176
Who is he trying
to show you off to?

477
00:47:27,011 --> 00:47:28,429
I guess he needs it.

478
00:47:29,597 --> 00:47:31,850
He's one strange husband.

479
00:47:32,767 --> 00:47:35,061
This is something
that would piss them off.

480
00:47:35,436 --> 00:47:38,982
But your husband asks
to have it worn.

481
00:47:45,029 --> 00:47:46,948
Does he want to brag about you?

482
00:47:49,033 --> 00:47:52,078
Everyone will look at you.

483
00:47:52,203 --> 00:47:55,874
So what if they look?
They're strangers.

484
00:47:57,750 --> 00:48:00,003
If he needs it,
I'll do it for him.

485
00:48:00,420 --> 00:48:02,297
It's the least I can do.

486
00:48:04,340 --> 00:48:06,050
Please finish it on time.

487
00:48:07,176 --> 00:48:11,389
I warned you!
All the women will hate you!

488
00:48:19,898 --> 00:48:20,898
Sir!

489
00:48:20,899 --> 00:48:22,775
- Good evening.
- Welcome.

490
00:48:26,946 --> 00:48:29,824
The backswing is important
at first.

491
00:48:30,992 --> 00:48:35,663
Push it into the mitt
of the catcher behind you.

492
00:48:35,747 --> 00:48:38,582
Then bring it right up

493
00:48:38,583 --> 00:48:43,086
and stretch out your left arm.

494
00:48:43,087 --> 00:48:45,006
See?

495
00:48:45,214 --> 00:48:47,634
And swing...

496
00:48:50,053 --> 00:48:53,306
It's the swing of an athlete.

497
00:48:53,431 --> 00:48:59,771
It's not only great but beautiful,
isn't it honey?

498
00:49:01,147 --> 00:49:04,317
Yes, you're really
an all-around athlete.

499
00:49:04,776 --> 00:49:08,780
When I learn golf in the future

500
00:49:08,988 --> 00:49:11,074
please give me lessons.

501
00:49:14,953 --> 00:49:19,540
Who's that lady in red?

502
00:49:25,797 --> 00:49:26,798
Who is it?

503
00:49:27,256 --> 00:49:32,135
Isn't that a crazy bitch?

504
00:49:32,136 --> 00:49:34,722
Bitch doesn't even come to my salon.

505
00:49:35,807 --> 00:49:40,227
At such an important event,
with even the chief of staff present.

506
00:49:40,228 --> 00:49:43,272
How dare she come
dressed like a call girl!

507
00:49:43,648 --> 00:49:45,108
What was she wearing?

508
00:49:47,610 --> 00:49:48,820
A bareback dress.

509
00:49:58,496 --> 00:50:03,167
From afar I thought
you were an actress.

510
00:50:03,459 --> 00:50:04,626
Thank you.

511
00:50:04,627 --> 00:50:07,629
Isn't she pretty?
Your dress paid off.

512
00:50:07,630 --> 00:50:08,964
You know what?

513
00:50:08,965 --> 00:50:13,093
My heart still flutters
when I see such a beauty.

514
00:50:13,094 --> 00:50:15,470
You're still young.

515
00:50:15,471 --> 00:50:18,474
- You think so? And not silly?
- Not at all.

516
00:50:20,685 --> 00:50:23,396
According to Colonel Kim,
your husband is an elite

517
00:50:23,438 --> 00:50:25,314
who studied in the U.S.

518
00:50:29,652 --> 00:50:31,029
Captain Kyung Woo-jin.

519
00:50:31,070 --> 00:50:35,742
Your husband is also dashing.
I can see he's very ambitious.

520
00:50:35,992 --> 00:50:39,411
It's an honor to meet you.
I have great respect for you.

521
00:50:39,412 --> 00:50:40,579
Is that so?

522
00:50:40,580 --> 00:50:46,210
Then can I make a request,
Captain Kang?

523
00:50:46,377 --> 00:50:48,378
It's Kyung, Captain Kyung.

524
00:50:48,379 --> 00:50:54,802
Captain Kyung,
can I have a dance with your wife?

525
00:50:55,053 --> 00:50:57,888
Of course.
I'll have my eyes closed tight.

526
00:50:57,889 --> 00:51:02,101
Look at this chap!
Joking with the chief of staff?

527
00:51:02,894 --> 00:51:04,645
I'll have you sent
to the guardhouse.

528
00:51:09,942 --> 00:51:14,405
With your husband's consent,
shall we dance?

529
00:51:15,281 --> 00:51:17,033
I don't know how to dance.

530
00:51:17,116 --> 00:51:20,286
I'm sorry,
I'll make sure I learn.

531
00:51:21,579 --> 00:51:23,372
She's so shy.

532
00:51:23,831 --> 00:51:25,333
Go out and try.

533
00:51:26,084 --> 00:51:27,960
Let's go!

534
00:51:28,795 --> 00:51:33,216
Colonel Kim, go change
the music for dancing.

535
00:51:52,026 --> 00:51:54,112
When did he get so drunk?

536
00:51:55,279 --> 00:51:58,241
Sound check, sound check.

537
00:51:58,533 --> 00:52:00,243
Attention!

538
00:52:01,077 --> 00:52:03,454
Colonel Kim Jin-pyong.

539
00:52:05,123 --> 00:52:10,461
I will present a song
to the chief of staff.

540
00:52:12,046 --> 00:52:15,716
Who asked for your song?

541
00:52:15,967 --> 00:52:18,136
It's dancing time.
Sing it later.

542
00:52:18,469 --> 00:52:22,306
I would like to dedicate
this song to the chief.

543
00:52:23,141 --> 00:52:24,225
For the chief!

544
00:52:25,393 --> 00:52:29,646
- Could you teach me how to dance?
- Play anything from Elvis.

545
00:52:29,647 --> 00:52:31,524
Of course.

546
00:52:40,074 --> 00:52:42,160
Everybody come out!

547
00:53:37,465 --> 00:53:39,383
I looked for you.

548
00:53:42,094 --> 00:53:46,015
You did that on purpose for me?

549
00:53:49,810 --> 00:53:52,396
I was a bit drunk.
I'm sorry.

550
00:53:57,401 --> 00:53:59,070
I'm slow-witted and...

551
00:54:05,243 --> 00:54:06,369
Thank you.

552
00:54:59,297 --> 00:55:02,717
What a fox.

553
00:55:03,301 --> 00:55:06,262
She was throwing herself
to the chief for her husband,

554
00:55:06,470 --> 00:55:07,971
wasn't she?

555
00:55:07,972 --> 00:55:14,770
I was grateful for
stopping my drunk husband.

556
00:55:14,812 --> 00:55:17,356
You are so generous.

557
00:55:18,649 --> 00:55:24,530
I met a person
who knows the couple.

558
00:55:26,365 --> 00:55:30,828
That woman is
as good as a war orphan.

559
00:55:30,911 --> 00:55:33,873
Really? No wonder...

560
00:55:33,998 --> 00:55:39,669
<i>During the war,
her family fled to the mountains</i>

561
00:55:39,670 --> 00:55:43,841
<i>being suspected as collaborators
with the Chinese army.</i>

562
00:55:46,093 --> 00:55:51,724
<i>Soon her father got dysentery.</i>

563
00:55:52,475 --> 00:55:55,853
<i>With nothing to eat
and an ill husband,</i>

564
00:55:56,228 --> 00:55:59,190
<i>her mother ran away.</i>

565
00:56:00,024 --> 00:56:02,360
<i>Not long after, her father died</i>

566
00:56:04,695 --> 00:56:07,990
<i>and the body began to rot.</i>

567
00:56:09,784 --> 00:56:13,621
<i>But that dreadful little child</i>

568
00:56:14,997 --> 00:56:17,248
<i>stayed next to the corpse
for a week</i>

569
00:56:17,249 --> 00:56:20,127
<i>before she came down
from the mountains.</i>

570
00:56:20,628 --> 00:56:26,425
That poor little thing...
Some more milk?

571
00:56:27,218 --> 00:56:32,932
What is there to pity?
She gives me the goosebumps.

572
00:56:32,973 --> 00:56:37,061
Captain Kyung's mother found
the wandering girl and took her in.

573
00:56:37,645 --> 00:56:42,024
She grew up as their maid.

574
00:56:42,233 --> 00:56:46,529
- Then she grew up with her husband?
- Isn't that devious, too?

575
00:56:46,904 --> 00:56:50,991
Hitting on her step-brother
and later marrying him,

576
00:56:51,742 --> 00:56:54,078
<i>she's no ordinary person.</i>

577
00:56:54,912 --> 00:56:57,415
<i>Nobody was against the marriage?</i>

578
00:56:58,082 --> 00:57:01,252
<i>Her mother-in-law backed the marriage.</i>

579
00:57:02,086 --> 00:57:04,171
<i>Didn't you say
she was their maid?</i>

580
00:57:06,215 --> 00:57:09,593
<i>Well, I guess her mother-in-law
really likes her.</i>

581
00:57:09,844 --> 00:57:11,512
<i>She raised the girl
like her own.</i>

582
00:57:12,805 --> 00:57:13,639
<i>Later...</i>

583
00:57:14,432 --> 00:57:15,933
I like her, too.

584
00:57:17,268 --> 00:57:20,563
I guess you have something in common.
Misery loves company.

585
00:57:33,742 --> 00:57:39,790
Could you come to my place
and make some kimchi?

586
00:57:40,708 --> 00:57:41,750
What?

587
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:43,877
Kimchi?

588
00:57:43,878 --> 00:57:46,797
I don't feel like
making it myself.

589
00:57:47,631 --> 00:57:48,966
I must be getting old.

590
00:57:52,470 --> 00:57:55,139
You can make it with me.
Let's do it together.

591
00:57:56,432 --> 00:58:00,311
The whole residence isn't needed
to make a little kimchi.

592
00:58:03,481 --> 00:58:04,607
I guess you don't want to.

593
00:58:07,109 --> 00:58:09,028
- Then I'll do it myself.
- No.

594
00:58:13,824 --> 00:58:17,828
I was wondering about
what kind of salted fish to use.

595
00:58:18,496 --> 00:58:20,956
Should I also make white kimchi?

596
00:58:21,749 --> 00:58:23,501
Just get it done.

597
00:58:25,252 --> 00:58:29,215
Don't bother me
about the details.

598
00:58:31,842 --> 00:58:33,636
I'll also make white kimchi.

599
00:58:35,304 --> 00:58:41,519
Un, deux, trois...
Un, deux, trios...

600
00:58:42,561 --> 00:58:43,687
Not again!

601
00:58:44,355 --> 00:58:46,523
Relax the shoulders.

602
00:58:46,524 --> 00:58:49,400
And the most important thing
is love.

603
00:58:49,401 --> 00:58:55,324
Without it, it's not a dance.
You're not giving me love.

604
00:58:58,077 --> 00:59:03,164
- But what's un, deux, trois?
- It's French for one, two, three.

605
00:59:03,165 --> 00:59:07,086
We use French for cultural things.
Now, along with the rhythm...

606
00:59:08,837 --> 00:59:12,215
It would be better with music.

607
00:59:12,216 --> 00:59:15,843
You're not at that stage yet.

608
00:59:15,844 --> 00:59:19,390
I have to be strict at first.
Now hold me.

609
00:59:23,435 --> 00:59:27,146
Un, deux, trois,

610
00:59:27,147 --> 00:59:31,360
un, deux, trois...
Good! That's right, you can do it!

611
00:59:31,986 --> 00:59:34,655
Wait, nature calls.

612
00:59:36,865 --> 00:59:38,074
What do I always say?

613
00:59:38,075 --> 00:59:42,245
You improve most
when practicing by yourself.

614
00:59:42,246 --> 00:59:48,002
Try to feel it.
You've gotten better, good!

615
01:00:41,180 --> 01:00:45,392
Can you feel it?
I'm half a beat later than you.

616
01:00:46,685 --> 01:00:51,190
This is the key.
The man leads the woman.

617
01:00:52,316 --> 01:00:54,109
You have talent, Commander.

618
01:00:56,111 --> 01:00:57,821
Feels good to be complimented.

619
01:00:59,198 --> 01:01:02,618
I think you like someone.

620
01:01:03,661 --> 01:01:07,998
I can see it as a dance teacher.
If not, I apologize.

621
01:01:12,336 --> 01:01:16,507
Does it show?

622
01:01:16,965 --> 01:01:21,095
How can it not show?
Your body is full of life.

623
01:01:22,721 --> 01:01:23,681
Again...

624
01:01:26,225 --> 01:01:27,184
Yes, sir.

625
01:01:29,019 --> 01:01:30,354
Un, deux, trios.

626
01:01:54,420 --> 01:01:57,338
So you boil it like this?

627
01:01:57,339 --> 01:02:02,803
No, later you'll see
the water going up.

628
01:02:03,637 --> 01:02:06,557
And the coffee will brew.

629
01:02:07,224 --> 01:02:09,518
The aroma is so good.

630
01:02:09,560 --> 01:02:13,897
This is so amazing!
I just love this atmosphere!

631
01:02:14,231 --> 01:02:17,443
It's like
I'm in an American coffee shop.

632
01:02:17,568 --> 01:02:20,362
- So this glass...
- It's hot.

633
01:02:22,740 --> 01:02:25,242
Wow, it's really going up!

634
01:02:27,327 --> 01:02:30,998
My uncle in the U.S.
sends me coffee.

635
01:02:31,665 --> 01:02:32,708
I'm so picky.

636
01:02:34,334 --> 01:02:37,421
<i>I want to see you, outside.</i>

637
01:02:45,220 --> 01:02:47,681
My husband is smoking again.

638
01:02:47,723 --> 01:02:50,808
This house is clean and nice
'cause nobody smokes.

639
01:02:50,809 --> 01:02:54,020
Isn't that right, Ga-heun?
He needs to quit.

640
01:02:54,021 --> 01:02:56,939
- The coffee...
- Is it brewing?

641
01:02:56,940 --> 01:02:58,233
Can you see it dripping?

642
01:03:01,487 --> 01:03:03,488
This is really wonderful!

643
01:03:03,489 --> 01:03:08,367
Oh my goodness, it's amazing!
So can we drink it now?

644
01:03:08,368 --> 01:03:11,078
It's still too light so wait.

645
01:03:11,079 --> 01:03:17,960
Then I'll prepare the cookies.

646
01:03:17,961 --> 01:03:21,006
<i>Tomorrow at two,
Chinese Cathedral</i>

647
01:03:21,031 --> 01:03:23,031
SharePirate.Com Subs

648
01:03:25,886 --> 01:03:28,180
- We can drink it now.
- Really?

649
01:03:31,350 --> 01:03:33,685
Isn't the aroma really nice?

650
01:03:35,771 --> 01:03:37,773
Where are the napkins?

651
01:04:48,093 --> 01:04:50,053
My heart won't stop beating.

652
01:04:50,888 --> 01:04:52,806
Is it because
you're holding my hand?

653
01:05:02,316 --> 01:05:04,318
I like your hand.

654
01:05:06,987 --> 01:05:12,075
I wanted to touch it
while we were dining.

655
01:08:49,459 --> 01:08:51,378
Commander,
this is Jin-pyong.

656
01:08:52,420 --> 01:08:55,465
The branch in your left hand.

657
01:08:55,841 --> 01:08:58,844
And hold the scissors.

658
01:08:59,553 --> 01:09:04,015
Hold it and
make a diagonal cut.

659
01:09:04,850 --> 01:09:07,227
Put it in the front.

660
01:09:09,312 --> 01:09:13,733
After placing it...

661
01:09:17,487 --> 01:09:20,740
The U.S. advisory group
is comin' to Seoul.

662
01:09:21,741 --> 01:09:26,955
And I'll be their
translator and guide.

663
01:09:27,164 --> 01:09:29,916
- Isn't that somethin'?
- That is something.

664
01:09:30,333 --> 01:09:32,169
At the party before...

665
01:09:32,502 --> 01:09:36,131
The corps commander
must've been smitten by me.

666
01:09:37,507 --> 01:09:41,553
And the colonel
recommended me, too.

667
01:09:42,679 --> 01:09:43,847
The colonel?

668
01:09:44,389 --> 01:09:48,935
Yep, I reckon he likes me.

669
01:09:50,187 --> 01:09:52,522
I have go on up
for preparations.

670
01:09:53,690 --> 01:09:58,486
I'll be gone
for a few days or more.

671
01:09:59,821 --> 01:10:02,365
Okie dokie?
I'm off.

672
01:10:17,547 --> 01:10:18,757
Who is it?

673
01:10:20,634 --> 01:10:21,550
It's me.

674
01:10:21,551 --> 01:10:24,721
I'm not going to open the door.

675
01:10:26,765 --> 01:10:27,724
What?

676
01:10:28,642 --> 01:10:31,811
I don't think I should open.

677
01:10:36,816 --> 01:10:40,153
Is something wrong?
Open up for a minute.

678
01:10:50,163 --> 01:10:51,706
Why, all of a sudden?

679
01:10:55,085 --> 01:10:59,422
You did it on purpose.

680
01:11:00,674 --> 01:11:02,259
Sending my husband away...

681
01:11:09,808 --> 01:11:11,768
I wanted to be alone with you.

682
01:11:17,274 --> 01:11:24,239
I'm so confused,
my head is about to burst.

683
01:11:27,033 --> 01:11:28,451
This is wrong.

684
01:11:28,660 --> 01:11:30,287
What we're doing...

685
01:11:36,084 --> 01:11:37,210
And this...

686
01:11:38,962 --> 01:11:43,049
I shouldn't keep it.
I'll give it back.

687
01:11:45,010 --> 01:11:46,469
I'm sorry.

688
01:12:04,237 --> 01:12:08,825
The Yankees are really something.
They're actually going to the moon.

689
01:12:10,994 --> 01:12:17,166
Going to the moon, yet losing
to the Vietcong in flip-flops...

690
01:12:17,167 --> 01:12:19,085
That's a mystery.

691
01:12:19,336 --> 01:12:21,004
Why are you drinking so much?

692
01:12:22,881 --> 01:12:25,175
Are you mad at me?

693
01:12:26,051 --> 01:12:26,843
Why?

694
01:12:27,344 --> 01:12:31,222
I didn't tell you about Haksu
and the dance lessons...

695
01:12:32,432 --> 01:12:39,396
Actually, Haksu arranges
stereo imports for me

696
01:12:39,397 --> 01:12:44,319
but it seems like
he's smuggling things in.

697
01:12:46,613 --> 01:12:51,743
That's why I didn't mention him
to you before.

698
01:12:56,831 --> 01:13:01,378
What's wrong with this?

699
01:13:01,461 --> 01:13:02,462
Better.

700
01:13:13,515 --> 01:13:15,141
I like someone.

701
01:13:18,770 --> 01:13:20,188
Now you're joking with me.

702
01:13:27,737 --> 01:13:29,030
Who is she?

703
01:13:34,077 --> 01:13:35,578
The wife of a subordinate.

704
01:13:38,957 --> 01:13:41,292
But she won't meet me anymore.

705
01:13:43,461 --> 01:13:45,713
I know I shouldn't,

706
01:13:47,090 --> 01:13:49,008
but I miss her like crazy.

707
01:14:01,396 --> 01:14:02,397
Did you?

708
01:14:08,778 --> 01:14:10,405
I can't say.

709
01:14:11,531 --> 01:14:12,907
I see you did.

710
01:14:14,242 --> 01:14:16,911
Make that your last.
You're not that kind of a person.

711
01:14:19,956 --> 01:14:22,125
They're landing.

712
01:14:23,334 --> 01:14:27,630
Shit, there's nothing.

713
01:14:28,089 --> 01:14:31,551
Using all that money
to go to such a place...

714
01:14:34,220 --> 01:14:36,514
This is fuckin' vain.

715
01:14:51,779 --> 01:14:54,449
That was fast.

716
01:14:54,782 --> 01:14:56,742
What brings you here?

717
01:14:56,743 --> 01:14:59,953
Your wife asked me to check on you.

718
01:14:59,954 --> 01:15:06,836
I brought seaweed soup
for your birthday tomorrow.

719
01:15:07,378 --> 01:15:12,133
If you didn't have dinner,
we can warm it up for you now.

720
01:15:13,343 --> 01:15:15,929
No, I'll eat it in the morning.

721
01:15:18,556 --> 01:15:19,556
Thank you.

722
01:15:19,557 --> 01:15:21,437
- We'll warm it up for you.
- We can warm it up.

723
01:16:28,167 --> 01:16:30,378
It's also your birthday today.

724
01:16:36,593 --> 01:16:40,555
It's seaweed soup.
Have some.

725
01:17:00,867 --> 01:17:02,994
I can't sleep or even breathe.

726
01:17:08,333 --> 01:17:10,126
It's so painful.

727
01:17:15,632 --> 01:17:16,591
It feels as though...

728
01:17:19,135 --> 01:17:20,762
as though my life
has been a waste.

729
01:17:24,223 --> 01:17:26,643
I didn't know
I was such a fool.

730
01:17:42,784 --> 01:17:45,119
I had the same thought.

731
01:17:48,206 --> 01:17:50,041
What kind of thought?

732
01:17:53,586 --> 01:17:56,297
Wish my husband is away.

733
01:17:57,006 --> 01:17:59,342
Wish I can be with you.

734
01:18:00,009 --> 01:18:01,511
That kind.

735
01:18:07,266 --> 01:18:10,353
But since you made it real,

736
01:18:12,563 --> 01:18:14,649
I got scared.

737
01:18:16,567 --> 01:18:18,403
And confused.

738
01:18:25,618 --> 01:18:26,619
I apologize.

739
01:18:28,413 --> 01:18:29,539
Even I...

740
01:18:32,542 --> 01:18:34,127
don't feel like myself.

741
01:18:42,051 --> 01:18:43,344
You really...

742
01:18:45,346 --> 01:18:47,098
couldn't breathe?

743
01:18:54,230 --> 01:18:58,568
What you said...
made me very happy.

744
01:19:00,820 --> 01:19:02,739
That you couldn't breathe.

745
01:19:06,409 --> 01:19:08,411
I thought it was just me.

746
01:19:27,472 --> 01:19:29,766
I shouldn't be in this room.

747
01:19:35,772 --> 01:19:37,607
I imagined this.

748
01:19:40,026 --> 01:19:41,569
Being with you.

749
01:19:43,112 --> 01:19:45,031
In this room.

750
01:20:01,839 --> 01:20:04,884
Is this where you were shot?

751
01:20:05,176 --> 01:20:05,968
Yes.

752
01:20:07,094 --> 01:20:09,138
How did it feel?

753
01:20:10,097 --> 01:20:11,265
It hurt.

754
01:20:17,939 --> 01:20:19,106
What about you?

755
01:20:21,567 --> 01:20:23,194
It hurt, too.

756
01:23:28,796 --> 01:23:30,589
- Frag out!
- Frag out!

757
01:24:00,202 --> 01:24:03,038
<i>Closed for Today</i>

758
01:24:03,039 --> 01:24:06,042
<i>I don't agree with you,
but have a good time...</i>

759
01:24:06,709 --> 01:24:08,878
<i>Polaroid instructions.</i>

760
01:24:37,490 --> 01:24:39,575
I forgot everything.

761
01:24:40,076 --> 01:24:41,660
I've just started learning.

762
01:24:49,668 --> 01:24:56,759
Un, deux, trios...

763
01:24:58,844 --> 01:25:02,723
- What's un, deux, trois?
- It's French.

764
01:25:08,771 --> 01:25:10,940
You're really good.

765
01:27:44,635 --> 01:27:50,140
You asked me what's it's like
with my husband?

766
01:27:53,811 --> 01:27:55,938
When I was about 13...

767
01:27:58,190 --> 01:28:01,110
He dragged me up to the attic.

768
01:28:04,530 --> 01:28:08,826
It was so bright there.

769
01:28:12,121 --> 01:28:14,206
He stripped me,

770
01:28:15,624 --> 01:28:17,209
and touched me.

771
01:28:18,627 --> 01:28:20,129
Too painfully.

772
01:28:23,882 --> 01:28:25,134
Must have been bad.

773
01:28:27,970 --> 01:28:30,097
I didn't feel anything.

774
01:28:30,806 --> 01:28:31,974
But...

775
01:28:32,808 --> 01:28:35,227
he was rather shocked.

776
01:28:37,604 --> 01:28:39,648
But now that we're married,

777
01:28:40,691 --> 01:28:42,985
I hate being touched.

778
01:28:51,994 --> 01:28:53,162
So I actually

779
01:28:55,622 --> 01:28:57,666
can't compare.

780
01:28:59,376 --> 01:29:01,128
You're the one,

781
01:29:02,004 --> 01:29:03,172
and only.

782
01:29:05,257 --> 01:29:06,842
My universe.

783
01:29:26,612 --> 01:29:28,197
It's me. How are things?

784
01:29:28,364 --> 01:29:32,617
<i>Everybody's taking it easy.
How is your cold?</i>

785
01:29:32,618 --> 01:29:36,120
Ah, much better now.

786
01:29:36,121 --> 01:29:39,624
<i>Captain Kyung's mother-in-law
is in the hospital.</i>

787
01:29:39,625 --> 01:29:40,917
What?

788
01:29:40,918 --> 01:29:44,170
<i>I went to tell his wife
but she wasn't home.</i>

789
01:29:44,171 --> 01:29:47,049
<i>It seemed serious.</i>

790
01:29:58,602 --> 01:29:59,686
Mother...

791
01:30:00,729 --> 01:30:06,735
You're here early.
I called her.

792
01:30:07,069 --> 01:30:10,656
I was shaking all over

793
01:30:11,490 --> 01:30:15,368
but I couldn't get to you.
So I called everyone.

794
01:30:15,369 --> 01:30:17,954
She had a stomach cramp.

795
01:30:17,955 --> 01:30:20,749
But it's not serious.

796
01:30:23,877 --> 01:30:25,462
But who is...?

797
01:30:27,381 --> 01:30:29,258
He's the training commander.

798
01:30:29,425 --> 01:30:30,509
Isn't he...

799
01:30:31,969 --> 01:30:33,345
so handsome?

800
01:30:35,180 --> 01:30:38,434
We must have something
with hospitals.

801
01:30:38,767 --> 01:30:40,269
Always meeting in hospitals.

802
01:30:41,979 --> 01:30:48,609
It hurt so much here...

803
01:30:48,610 --> 01:30:50,612
How did you come together?

804
01:30:51,447 --> 01:30:57,161
It was an emergency
so I asked him to drive me here.

805
01:30:59,913 --> 01:31:01,707
I apologize for the trouble.

806
01:31:03,584 --> 01:31:07,795
Not at all.
Then I'll leave you...

807
01:31:07,796 --> 01:31:12,967
No, I don't have anything to do.
So I can stay here.

808
01:31:12,968 --> 01:31:19,141
Could you wait for a moment
and drive her back?

809
01:31:45,501 --> 01:31:46,668
Is he the one?

810
01:31:47,836 --> 01:31:48,712
What?

811
01:31:48,754 --> 01:31:51,507
The one you like.
Is it him?

812
01:31:54,551 --> 01:31:56,637
I felt it last time.

813
01:31:58,013 --> 01:32:00,516
That you are into someone.

814
01:32:04,770 --> 01:32:06,355
I'm sorry.

815
01:32:06,438 --> 01:32:07,940
Don't say such thing.

816
01:32:09,107 --> 01:32:11,360
It's not a sin to like someone.

817
01:32:15,364 --> 01:32:19,326
You know what I'm really
sorry about?

818
01:32:21,036 --> 01:32:23,539
Marrying you to an evil man.

819
01:32:24,623 --> 01:32:26,124
Mother...

820
01:32:27,125 --> 01:32:29,253
My son is evil.

821
01:32:29,545 --> 01:32:33,090
Looks fine, but he is bad.

822
01:32:33,882 --> 01:32:36,009
That's why I relied on you.

823
01:32:39,137 --> 01:32:40,806
When you're a daughter to me.

824
01:32:42,933 --> 01:32:45,102
Aren't I evil too?

825
01:32:53,610 --> 01:32:56,321
Your mother-in-law
must have thought it strange

826
01:32:58,407 --> 01:32:59,783
that I drove you there.

827
01:33:03,120 --> 01:33:05,038
She knew the moment she saw you

828
01:33:07,541 --> 01:33:09,668
that I love you.

829
01:33:13,589 --> 01:33:15,090
I couldn't...

830
01:33:17,593 --> 01:33:19,261
hide my feelings.

831
01:33:31,064 --> 01:33:33,567
There's no use lying.

832
01:33:35,444 --> 01:33:38,113
It's the first time
I'm in love.

833
01:33:39,906 --> 01:33:41,908
How can she not know?

834
01:33:44,995 --> 01:33:46,121
So...

835
01:33:48,540 --> 01:33:50,000
what did she say?

836
01:33:53,670 --> 01:33:59,676
To do as I please
if I really love you.

837
01:34:02,471 --> 01:34:04,222
She said she was on my side.

838
01:34:12,397 --> 01:34:13,774
What do I do?

839
01:34:15,150 --> 01:34:17,235
I love you so much.

840
01:34:18,862 --> 01:34:21,198
But what she said...

841
01:34:24,034 --> 01:34:25,786
It tears me apart.

842
01:34:30,666 --> 01:34:32,042
What should I do?

843
01:34:33,877 --> 01:34:35,962
I love you so much, but...

844
01:35:00,904 --> 01:35:03,115
I won't see you anymore.

845
01:35:04,157 --> 01:35:05,283
I mean it.

846
01:35:06,201 --> 01:35:07,661
I'll try.

847
01:35:09,413 --> 01:35:11,707
Can you also try?

848
01:35:13,709 --> 01:35:14,876
For me?

849
01:36:22,235 --> 01:36:24,111
Are you looking for something?

850
01:36:24,112 --> 01:36:27,699
No, it's messy so I cleaned up.

851
01:36:40,796 --> 01:36:45,759
I visited the Commissioner
and found her there!

852
01:36:46,092 --> 01:36:50,054
When I talk with the Mrs.,
she'd cut in.

853
01:36:50,055 --> 01:36:52,057
Each and every time.

854
01:37:08,156 --> 01:37:08,990
What's wrong?

855
01:37:09,324 --> 01:37:11,493
I need to listen to music.

856
01:37:12,869 --> 01:37:14,203
I'll be out downtown.

857
01:37:14,204 --> 01:37:15,454
At this hour?

858
01:37:15,455 --> 01:37:18,082
Have some fruit.
You barely ate at dinner.

859
01:37:18,083 --> 01:37:19,459
I feel too stuffy.

860
01:37:20,752 --> 01:37:21,837
I'll be back.

861
01:37:22,128 --> 01:37:25,465
So, when do we go?

862
01:37:26,508 --> 01:37:27,174
Where?

863
01:37:27,175 --> 01:37:29,134
The Commissioner's!

864
01:37:29,135 --> 01:37:30,679
Did you listen at all?

865
01:37:34,850 --> 01:37:36,059
I don't pay visits like that.

866
01:37:37,686 --> 01:37:38,770
You know me.

867
01:37:52,325 --> 01:37:55,703
Your bosoms have changed.

868
01:37:55,704 --> 01:37:58,873
- No, they haven't.
- Yes, they've changed.

869
01:37:58,874 --> 01:38:00,416
That's strange.

870
01:38:00,417 --> 01:38:04,796
My hands are really sensitive.

871
01:38:05,797 --> 01:38:09,968
- I think I'll have to check.
- Haksu...

872
01:38:12,220 --> 01:38:13,346
Commander.

873
01:38:16,057 --> 01:38:17,434
Help me.

874
01:38:26,568 --> 01:38:27,402
What is it?

875
01:38:28,653 --> 01:38:29,613
Tell me.

876
01:38:51,551 --> 01:38:53,553
Hello, pretty!

877
01:38:56,556 --> 01:38:58,808
I love Yankee stuff.

878
01:39:03,313 --> 01:39:05,523
Who's there?

879
01:39:05,607 --> 01:39:09,486
- Good evening, sir.
- Put out the lights!

880
01:39:09,694 --> 01:39:13,072
We heard you smuggled
military goods in that container.

881
01:39:13,073 --> 01:39:17,786
This went through customs.
Turn off the lights!

882
01:39:18,828 --> 01:39:20,914
We'll just check it.

883
01:39:21,790 --> 01:39:24,626
Come and check it then.

884
01:39:26,628 --> 01:39:29,005
I can't believe this!

885
01:39:31,633 --> 01:39:32,550
Stop right there!

886
01:39:34,636 --> 01:39:36,221
Stop, you son of a bitch!

887
01:39:36,846 --> 01:39:40,141
- I said it really ain't me!
- How can I believe you?

888
01:39:40,642 --> 01:39:45,312
Your father's smuggling
caused me grief all my life.

889
01:39:45,313 --> 01:39:47,899
It really ain't me, ma...

890
01:39:48,274 --> 01:39:56,274
I've asked for lil' stuff
like cosmetics and cigarettes for gifts.

891
01:39:56,574 --> 01:39:59,703
How can I smuggle in
a whole container?

892
01:39:59,995 --> 01:40:02,496
I ain't got the money!

893
01:40:02,497 --> 01:40:06,668
- You must've borrowed it.
- Borrow money? Me?

894
01:40:08,837 --> 01:40:09,713
Hey.

895
01:40:10,839 --> 01:40:13,174
Say something!

896
01:40:15,301 --> 01:40:19,681
Then what about your name
and the list of items?

897
01:40:19,764 --> 01:40:21,224
I ain't got a clue.

898
01:40:23,601 --> 01:40:28,481
I never heard of the fuckin'
Myeongil trading company.

899
01:40:30,692 --> 01:40:32,235
This is...

900
01:40:33,194 --> 01:40:34,821
Strange.

901
01:40:36,156 --> 01:40:37,365
Somethin's fishy.

902
01:40:41,161 --> 01:40:44,122
So are you going to jail?

903
01:40:44,664 --> 01:40:46,583
I dunno, fuck!

904
01:40:50,503 --> 01:40:54,924
They'll let me off
if I volunteer for Vietnam.

905
01:40:55,216 --> 01:40:57,385
But I just came back...

906
01:41:05,727 --> 01:41:10,398
Ma... you know I was
just about to get it going.

907
01:41:13,443 --> 01:41:18,031
This ain't right.
This is a setup!

908
01:41:35,006 --> 01:41:38,927
It wasn't him, was it?

909
01:41:40,762 --> 01:41:41,805
No...

910
01:41:41,846 --> 01:41:47,268
He's lied to me many times,
just like his dad

911
01:41:47,769 --> 01:41:50,480
so I know when he's lying.

912
01:41:51,147 --> 01:41:54,192
But this time he's not.

913
01:41:55,652 --> 01:41:57,529
It's a setup.

914
01:41:59,781 --> 01:42:03,493
I think somehow
this is linked to you.

915
01:42:04,160 --> 01:42:06,996
- Mother, I...
- Don't say a word.

916
01:42:07,914 --> 01:42:10,667
Get him out.

917
01:43:46,554 --> 01:43:49,682
How gorgeous!

918
01:43:49,766 --> 01:43:53,144
Madam, you look just like
Sophia Loren!

919
01:43:53,394 --> 01:43:56,188
With that body anything will fit.

920
01:43:56,189 --> 01:43:58,775
It looks so good on you.

921
01:43:59,025 --> 01:44:04,655
What's with calling me Madam?
Just be comfortable as before.

922
01:44:04,656 --> 01:44:08,242
What do you mean? To the new
training commander's wife?

923
01:44:08,243 --> 01:44:11,788
- One, two, three...
- Madam!

924
01:44:12,497 --> 01:44:14,748
Please!

925
01:44:14,749 --> 01:44:19,170
What happens to
Colonel Kim now?

926
01:44:22,298 --> 01:44:24,050
He's waiting to be assigned.

927
01:44:24,592 --> 01:44:27,262
It actually means
they want him to quit.

928
01:44:27,512 --> 01:44:30,223
What's the reason? Wasn't he
at the top of the line?

929
01:44:31,224 --> 01:44:35,770
Being so tight-lipped
I never told you,

930
01:44:35,979 --> 01:44:39,107
but every high-ranking official knows.

931
01:44:40,650 --> 01:44:44,320
He's on medication.

932
01:44:45,446 --> 01:44:48,366
A mentally ill person
can't command a troop.

933
01:44:49,200 --> 01:44:52,203
He treated
his subordinates well.

934
01:44:52,287 --> 01:44:56,541
He saved Captain Kyung.
Captain Kyung must be really sad.

935
01:44:57,834 --> 01:45:01,087
Captain Kyung?
He didn't look sad.

936
01:45:01,129 --> 01:45:03,589
He does all of my housework
these clays.

937
01:45:04,382 --> 01:45:06,467
He's even ready
to do my laundry.

938
01:45:07,885 --> 01:45:09,137
My my.

939
01:45:10,388 --> 01:45:12,390
What use is a war hero?

940
01:45:13,975 --> 01:45:15,476
And that

941
01:45:16,394 --> 01:45:18,146
Colonel Kim fellow...

942
01:45:19,314 --> 01:45:21,566
is weak at human relations.

943
01:45:26,571 --> 01:45:28,406
Do you need to call him that?

944
01:45:32,368 --> 01:45:34,495
You look pathetic right now.

945
01:45:51,179 --> 01:45:52,096
What?

946
01:45:52,805 --> 01:45:56,517
Should have sent a better present
to the Commissioner.

947
01:45:57,602 --> 01:46:02,690
You stupid fool.

948
01:46:03,024 --> 01:46:05,568
Anyway, Colonel fellow.

949
01:46:06,194 --> 01:46:08,821
He's over.

950
01:46:16,079 --> 01:46:17,288
Is it your stuff?

951
01:46:18,539 --> 01:46:19,374
Yes.

952
01:46:22,043 --> 01:46:24,295
- I'm sorry.
- There's nothing to be sorry for.

953
01:46:27,548 --> 01:46:29,509
My father told me as a child

954
01:46:31,344 --> 01:46:34,764
never to bring
your work stuff home

955
01:46:35,640 --> 01:46:37,517
because it made you look
very shabby.

956
01:46:39,185 --> 01:46:42,397
- But I broke that promise.
- You don't look a bit shabby.

957
01:46:43,815 --> 01:46:46,109
- I'll wash up.
- Wait...

958
01:46:51,572 --> 01:46:58,829
Happy promotion to you!
Happy promotion to you!

959
01:46:58,830 --> 01:47:04,000
Dear Commodore!

960
01:47:04,001 --> 01:47:10,258
Happy promotion to you!

961
01:47:13,428 --> 01:47:14,303
What is this?

962
01:47:17,265 --> 01:47:20,434
You've been promoted to
a general.

963
01:47:20,435 --> 01:47:21,685
Congratulations!

964
01:47:21,686 --> 01:47:24,020
Congratulation, General!

965
01:47:24,021 --> 01:47:27,107
General! General!

966
01:47:27,108 --> 01:47:30,403
The president gave special orders
for this promotion.

967
01:47:31,654 --> 01:47:32,572
What?

968
01:47:33,114 --> 01:47:36,492
The president, himself?

969
01:47:37,118 --> 01:47:40,288
The president visited Vietnam
and the front line.

970
01:47:40,496 --> 01:47:46,835
My husband briefed him
but it was too noisy.

971
01:47:46,836 --> 01:47:49,505
And as you all know,
Colonel Kim has a small voice.

972
01:47:51,048 --> 01:47:52,967
I like that voice.

973
01:47:54,093 --> 01:47:59,640
The president said
â€œSpeak up, I can't hear you.â€

974
01:48:00,141 --> 01:48:03,394
My husband said
â€œMy voice cracks if I speak louder.

975
01:48:03,728 --> 01:48:07,356
And I'll look like a fool
to my subordinates.â€

976
01:48:10,860 --> 01:48:12,235
How about a drink?

977
01:48:12,236 --> 01:48:16,157
He talked back to the president.

978
01:48:16,449 --> 01:48:21,329
But the president
brought up his chair nearer.

979
01:48:22,705 --> 01:48:24,248
So nobody could say anything.

980
01:48:27,919 --> 01:48:32,256
The president
must have remembered my husband.

981
01:48:32,924 --> 01:48:36,135
So he gave special orders.

982
01:48:36,344 --> 01:48:37,386
Right, honey?

983
01:48:38,596 --> 01:48:46,312
Truth indeed wins out in the long run.
Everything is set right in the end.

984
01:48:48,022 --> 01:48:53,735
We felt so bad
being the only ones promoted.

985
01:48:53,736 --> 01:48:56,280
That's okay.

986
01:48:58,449 --> 01:49:02,745
The Assistant Chief of Staff
is a key post,

987
01:49:03,037 --> 01:49:05,081
mostly for two-star officers.

988
01:49:06,082 --> 01:49:07,583
This is incredible!

989
01:49:08,042 --> 01:49:11,546
- Let's have a toast!
- Wait...

990
01:49:12,463 --> 01:49:17,051
- I prepared some barbecue.
- Captain Kyung!

991
01:49:17,718 --> 01:49:21,097
Congratulations, Commodore Kim!
You're the best.

992
01:49:22,431 --> 01:49:23,683
So impressive!

993
01:49:24,725 --> 01:49:25,935
Why don't you make a toast.

994
01:49:31,065 --> 01:49:35,778
I have another announcement.
It's nothing big,

995
01:49:35,945 --> 01:49:38,781
but I'm pregnant.

996
01:49:47,290 --> 01:49:50,585
My husband didn't know.
I wanted to be careful.

997
01:49:51,168 --> 01:49:56,090
You can congratulate me.
I'm finally becoming a mother.

998
01:49:57,300 --> 01:49:58,092
Congratulations!

999
01:50:02,805 --> 01:50:04,432
Congratulations!

1000
01:50:08,144 --> 01:50:10,479
It's a double celebration.
She's pregnant!

1001
01:50:21,782 --> 01:50:25,994
Rumors had it you'd lost your lead,

1002
01:50:25,995 --> 01:50:28,664
but I believed in you.

1003
01:50:28,956 --> 01:50:30,206
So did I!

1004
01:50:30,207 --> 01:50:32,125
Me, too!

1005
01:50:32,126 --> 01:50:39,299
He's a Vietnam War hero
and the military academy's top student!

1006
01:50:39,300 --> 01:50:44,305
Nobody can win over the Commodore.
I guarantee!

1007
01:50:46,474 --> 01:50:48,559
Nobody!

1008
01:50:51,979 --> 01:50:56,817
Commodore, don't forget me
even if you leave!

1009
01:51:43,531 --> 01:51:44,824
Why are you outside?

1010
01:51:47,451 --> 01:51:49,870
It's more comfortable here.

1011
01:51:51,956 --> 01:51:55,334
Why are you drinking so much?

1012
01:52:02,299 --> 01:52:03,884
I told Captain Kyung.

1013
01:52:05,094 --> 01:52:06,053
What?

1014
01:52:06,303 --> 01:52:11,142
To come with me to Seoul,
as my aide-de-camp.

1015
01:52:13,352 --> 01:52:15,187
I'm going to treat him well

1016
01:52:19,316 --> 01:52:21,652
because I've committed a great sin.

1017
01:52:32,496 --> 01:52:33,748
But...

1018
01:52:38,461 --> 01:52:39,879
I'm not going.

1019
01:52:44,258 --> 01:52:45,384
Why not...

1020
01:52:45,885 --> 01:52:47,052
Because then...

1021
01:52:49,597 --> 01:52:51,474
I'll meet you.

1022
01:52:53,684 --> 01:52:54,935
Why can't we meet?

1023
01:52:57,813 --> 01:53:00,775
I told you,
I'm not seeing you anymore.

1024
01:53:00,858 --> 01:53:02,318
Then what about me?

1025
01:53:03,277 --> 01:53:04,987
I have no choice.

1026
01:53:06,489 --> 01:53:08,240
They need more barbecue.

1027
01:53:13,287 --> 01:53:15,456
- Stop, he sees us.
- Talk to me!

1028
01:53:17,166 --> 01:53:18,459
What about me?

1029
01:53:18,501 --> 01:53:23,005
You've clone well,
and will continue to do so.

1030
01:53:33,891 --> 01:53:37,520
Thanks a lot, darling.

1031
01:53:39,563 --> 01:53:40,815
Then why?

1032
01:53:42,149 --> 01:53:45,151
If you were going to
dump me like this

1033
01:53:45,152 --> 01:53:47,195
why did you make me want you?

1034
01:53:47,196 --> 01:53:48,655
Are you drunk?

1035
01:53:48,656 --> 01:53:49,489
Answer me!

1036
01:53:49,490 --> 01:53:51,158
I don't know
what you're talking about.

1037
01:53:51,408 --> 01:53:52,451
You don't know?

1038
01:53:53,202 --> 01:53:54,328
Don't know?

1039
01:53:55,496 --> 01:53:57,623
Why are you dumping me?

1040
01:53:57,665 --> 01:53:59,667
You're drunk, it hurts.
Let me go.

1041
01:54:00,042 --> 01:54:02,253
Answer me, why did you...

1042
01:54:02,628 --> 01:54:03,962
- Stop it, sir.
- Let go.

1043
01:54:03,963 --> 01:54:05,713
Why don't you stop it.

1044
01:54:05,714 --> 01:54:06,632
What?

1045
01:54:08,133 --> 01:54:11,345
You little weasel!
Shitty son of a bitch!

1046
01:54:13,264 --> 01:54:14,806
- Come here!
- Colonel!

1047
01:54:14,807 --> 01:54:17,851
- Come here!
- Hold him!

1048
01:54:17,852 --> 01:54:20,312
Let go!

1049
01:54:20,980 --> 01:54:23,774
Bring her here!

1050
01:54:25,359 --> 01:54:28,529
- Let go, you shit heads!
- Take him to his room.

1051
01:54:29,154 --> 01:54:33,617
Let go, come back!
Let go, you assholes!

1052
01:54:38,289 --> 01:54:41,876
I knew it from the beginning.

1053
01:54:53,971 --> 01:54:54,972
Bottoms up.

1054
01:55:06,609 --> 01:55:10,195
Go to Vietnam for a year.

1055
01:55:11,363 --> 01:55:16,911
They'll know,
but it'll be better than here.

1056
01:55:18,078 --> 01:55:19,204
I'm sorry.

1057
01:55:19,914 --> 01:55:21,540
Don't be sorry.

1058
01:55:22,333 --> 01:55:24,125
There's a Japanese saying

1059
01:55:24,126 --> 01:55:25,961
that you can find no fault
below the belt.

1060
01:55:27,630 --> 01:55:30,507
A man can make mistakes.

1061
01:55:31,425 --> 01:55:34,094
Do some reflection in Vietnam.

1062
01:55:36,430 --> 01:55:40,851
Don't you like Vietnam?

1063
01:55:41,769 --> 01:55:45,606
You were a hero.
So it must fit you.

1064
01:55:50,444 --> 01:55:53,113
You humiliated my daughter,
son of a bitch!

1065
01:56:04,083 --> 01:56:05,793
She's even pregnant.

1066
01:56:06,877 --> 01:56:10,172
You jerk,
you were almost there!

1067
01:56:13,425 --> 01:56:15,010
Stupid son of a bitch.

1068
01:56:16,929 --> 01:56:21,892
Sook-jin says she'll see you
when you're back. Just pack and leave.

1069
01:56:22,810 --> 01:56:25,479
I'll take care of the rest.

1070
01:56:27,982 --> 01:56:29,608
Pathetic bastard.

1071
01:57:34,757 --> 01:57:37,134
I have something to say
to Captain Kyung.

1072
01:57:40,387 --> 01:57:42,848
He left for Seoul.

1073
01:57:50,564 --> 01:57:52,649
I need to
apologize to you, too.

1074
01:57:56,904 --> 01:57:58,072
I'm sorry.

1075
01:58:03,619 --> 01:58:05,037
I heard...

1076
01:58:07,414 --> 01:58:09,249
you were going to Vietnam.

1077
01:58:15,255 --> 01:58:17,049
Be safe.

1078
01:58:21,178 --> 01:58:22,429
Good-bye.

1079
01:58:25,099 --> 01:58:25,933
Wait...

1080
01:58:27,351 --> 01:58:30,687
I just want to ask you
one thing.

1081
01:58:31,980 --> 01:58:33,148
Don't worry.

1082
01:58:35,275 --> 01:58:36,026
Okay.

1083
01:58:42,783 --> 01:58:43,951
Did you...

1084
01:58:48,664 --> 01:58:49,832
love me?

1085
01:58:58,715 --> 01:58:59,716
Do you still...

1086
01:59:01,802 --> 01:59:03,637
love me now?

1087
01:59:08,100 --> 01:59:09,268
I...

1088
01:59:12,563 --> 01:59:14,106
I love you.

1089
01:59:24,741 --> 01:59:28,829
In fact,
I'm not leaving for Vietnam.

1090
01:59:30,497 --> 01:59:32,666
I can't stay in the military
like this.

1091
01:59:32,791 --> 01:59:33,959
Then what?

1092
01:59:35,544 --> 01:59:39,506
While serving in Vietnam,
I visited Thailand.

1093
01:59:42,134 --> 01:59:43,844
There was this beach...

1094
01:59:45,679 --> 01:59:49,391
It was so peaceful and nice
I vowed I'd come again.

1095
01:59:50,392 --> 01:59:52,019
I'm going there.

1096
01:59:52,477 --> 01:59:53,687
Don't.

1097
01:59:54,396 --> 01:59:57,858
Nobody will remember this
after a year.

1098
01:59:59,359 --> 02:00:00,194
No...

1099
02:00:01,361 --> 02:00:02,988
This is the right decision.

1100
02:00:04,531 --> 02:00:05,824
So I was wondering...

1101
02:00:07,701 --> 02:00:10,037
if you could go with me?

1102
02:00:11,872 --> 02:00:17,044
You don't have to answer now.
You can join me later.

1103
02:00:18,545 --> 02:00:20,631
I'll write you.

1104
02:00:23,217 --> 02:00:25,969
So join me later?

1105
02:00:30,432 --> 02:00:33,560
I won't ruin you again.

1106
02:00:34,853 --> 02:00:36,146
And...

1107
02:00:36,563 --> 02:00:41,109
I can't give up everything.

1108
02:00:44,112 --> 02:00:45,405
I don't love you enough.

1109
02:00:55,123 --> 02:00:56,291
I see...

1110
02:01:00,212 --> 02:01:03,423
I didn't know.
You should've told me sooner.

1111
02:01:04,758 --> 02:01:07,761
- I'm sorry. Bye.
- Wait!

1112
02:01:09,930 --> 02:01:11,306
Wait...

1113
02:01:13,267 --> 02:01:14,601
You know what...

1114
02:01:18,647 --> 02:01:19,815
Actually...

1115
02:01:23,735 --> 02:01:25,696
I can't live without you.

1116
02:01:29,324 --> 02:01:30,701
I can't sleep.

1117
02:01:32,244 --> 02:01:34,454
I can't eat and...

1118
02:01:37,082 --> 02:01:38,625
I can't breathe.

1119
02:01:41,420 --> 02:01:48,385
It's so suffocating
I can't live.

1120
02:03:10,926 --> 02:03:14,346
Then there's no pension?

1121
02:03:15,222 --> 02:03:19,017
Of course,
he was dishonorably discharged.

1122
02:03:19,768 --> 02:03:22,646
Divorced and
dishonorably discharged...

1123
02:03:24,189 --> 02:03:26,441
The poor Colonel...

1124
02:03:26,566 --> 02:03:30,570
What's to pity?
It's a miracle he didn't die.

1125
02:03:31,238 --> 02:03:34,241
He missed his heart
by a centimeter.

1126
02:03:34,324 --> 02:03:37,035
She surely lived life
to the fullest.

1127
02:03:37,744 --> 02:03:45,502
I can't imagine
having a man die for me.

1128
02:03:46,628 --> 02:03:51,341
Do you think you would
follow a man like that?

1129
02:03:52,926 --> 02:03:55,679
Are you crazy?
That's nonsense...

1130
02:04:04,938 --> 02:04:06,231
What about you?

1131

<i>Two years later - Winter of 1971</i>

1132
02:04:34,468 --> 02:04:36,678
Someone is here for you.

1133
02:05:16,676 --> 02:05:17,552
Ma'am...

1134
02:05:22,766 --> 02:05:25,227
Are you the wife of
Major Kyung Woo-jin?

1135
02:05:26,353 --> 02:05:28,188
I'm Jong Ga-heun.

1136
02:05:29,147 --> 02:05:30,524
What's the matter?

1137
02:05:33,860 --> 02:05:35,529
The woman in this photo...

1138
02:05:37,030 --> 02:05:38,865
Is it you?

1139
02:05:38,990 --> 02:05:42,202
<i>September 26, 1969

1140
02:05:46,039 --> 02:05:47,123
This photo...

1141
02:05:48,959 --> 02:05:51,211
We're from Vietnam.

1142
02:05:52,546 --> 02:05:58,552
That man guided the special forces
across the Laos border.

1143
02:06:00,387 --> 02:06:04,391
He was neither a soldier
nor a civilian.

1144
02:06:05,225 --> 02:06:06,546
During an infiltration operation,

1145
02:06:07,978 --> 02:06:11,022
he was shot and died.

1146
02:06:17,279 --> 02:06:18,446
But...

1147
02:06:19,072 --> 02:06:21,408
nobody knew his identity.

1148
02:06:24,077 --> 02:06:25,579
He had no belongings.

1149
02:06:26,204 --> 02:06:29,040
All he had was this photo
in his pocket.

1150
02:06:32,085 --> 02:06:37,465
I asked around everywhere
to return this to you.

1151
02:06:39,634 --> 02:06:40,760
Ma'am...

1152
02:06:41,720 --> 02:06:43,888
Look behind it.

1153
02:06:53,648 --> 02:06:57,152
<i>My Love</i>

1154
02:07:06,369 --> 02:07:12,333
Right before he died,
he kept on pulling at his pocket.

1155
02:07:12,334 --> 02:07:14,214
So we took out this photo...
wrapped in plastic.

1156
02:07:16,296 --> 02:07:18,256
He died looking at this.

1157
02:07:19,507 --> 02:07:20,592
He even smiled.

1158
02:07:26,973 --> 02:07:32,812
<i>Jong Ga-heun</i>

1159
02:08:20,235 --> 02:08:22,362
Let me write my name here.

1160
02:08:24,280 --> 02:08:26,658
Don't forget me 'til you die.

1161
02:08:28,827 --> 02:08:30,036
Promise?

1162
02:08:43,091 --> 02:08:44,217
I'll never forget.

1163
02:09:31,848 --> 02:09:32,392
OBSESSED

1164
02:09:42,776 --> 02:09:43,902
You look scared.

1165
02:09:44,903 --> 02:09:46,321
Take it easy.
