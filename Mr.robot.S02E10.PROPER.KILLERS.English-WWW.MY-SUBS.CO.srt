00:00:00,063 --> 00:00:01,265
_

2
00:00:01,289 --> 00:00:02,819
The lights have been flickering.

3
00:00:02,844 --> 00:00:04,483
Yeah, the streetlights too.

4
00:00:04,508 --> 00:00:05,841
Brownout's started.

5
00:00:05,876 --> 00:00:07,309
Mr. Alderson, you're under arrest.

6
00:00:07,344 --> 00:00:08,744
Grab the computers, get the hard drives,

7
00:00:08,779 --> 00:00:10,246
all the USB drives...

8
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:12,681
I want you to lead the D.C. op.

9
00:00:12,716 --> 00:00:15,017
You can stay here and
crash on the couch.

10
00:00:15,051 --> 00:00:16,452
Home would be better.

11
00:00:16,486 --> 00:00:18,053
Have you spoken to the administration?

12
00:00:18,088 --> 00:00:19,488
We're not there yet.

13
00:00:19,523 --> 00:00:21,190
<i>There he is, Terry Colby, the CTO.</i>

14
00:00:21,224 --> 00:00:23,159
You can't be offering me a job there.

15
00:00:23,193 --> 00:00:24,794
You're testifying against them.

16
00:00:24,828 --> 00:00:27,630
In business, grudges
aren't really a thing.

17
00:00:27,664 --> 00:00:30,199
- You do work at E Corp.
- I never said that.

18
00:00:30,233 --> 00:00:31,967
Best case scenario, I lose my job

19
00:00:32,002 --> 00:00:33,903
and plea bargain down a jail sentence.

20
00:00:33,937 --> 00:00:35,237
I'm backed into a corner.

21
00:00:35,272 --> 00:00:37,873
I wanted to be Claudia Kincaid so bad.

22
00:00:37,908 --> 00:00:40,376
Ollie Parker told me
about the CD at Allsafe.

23
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:42,144
Eventually, someone
will connect the dots,

24
00:00:42,179 --> 00:00:43,512
and it'll catch up to you.

25
00:00:43,547 --> 00:00:45,514
The Dark Army are just hackers.

26
00:00:45,549 --> 00:00:46,982
I clipped one of the
shooters in the leg.

27
00:00:47,017 --> 00:00:48,851
He turned the gun on himself.

28
00:00:48,885 --> 00:00:50,519
He erased his history.

29
00:00:50,554 --> 00:00:52,421
Tyrell's always surprising
me with little gifts.

30
00:00:54,791 --> 00:00:57,259
I have a contact attempting
to trace the phone calls,

31
00:00:57,294 --> 00:00:58,661
but he needs more time.

32
00:00:58,695 --> 00:01:00,196
<i>Mobley and Trenton both are AWOL.</i>

33
00:01:01,932 --> 00:01:04,266
<i>In that dream I had, when
I was being drowned,</i>

34
00:01:04,301 --> 00:01:06,001
<i>it was when I stopped fighting it.</i>

35
00:01:06,036 --> 00:01:08,070
<i>That's when I survived.</i>

36
00:01:08,104 --> 00:01:09,572
Hello, Ollie.

37
00:01:13,376 --> 00:01:14,777
It's a gift. I...

38
00:01:14,811 --> 00:01:17,513
I wanted to give it to
you before I forgot.

39
00:01:17,547 --> 00:01:19,415
That's my last advance copy.

40
00:01:19,449 --> 00:01:22,218
It's trending on Amazon's
Movers & Shakers.

41
00:01:22,252 --> 00:01:23,919
It's ahead of Trump's latest.

42
00:01:23,954 --> 00:01:27,389
Can you believe that cocksucker
is actually running this time?

43
00:01:27,424 --> 00:01:31,060
I mean, if I wanted, the
things I have on him

44
00:01:31,094 --> 00:01:34,196
could put me on his ticket.

45
00:01:34,231 --> 00:01:36,365
Politics...

46
00:01:36,399 --> 00:01:38,133
is for puppets.

47
00:01:38,168 --> 00:01:40,703
Besides, if you did run for office,

48
00:01:40,737 --> 00:01:44,106
you'd no longer be
"The Last Honest Man."

49
00:01:46,076 --> 00:01:47,376
Thank you, Terry.

50
00:01:47,410 --> 00:01:51,380
Anyway, I need you to see our friend,

51
00:01:51,414 --> 00:01:52,648
Winston Campbell,

52
00:01:52,682 --> 00:01:56,752
about this issue tonight.

53
00:01:56,786 --> 00:02:00,456
I understand he still
owes you some favors.

54
00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:04,960
He does.

55
00:02:04,995 --> 00:02:08,731
But a UN vote allowing China
to annex the Congo?

56
00:02:08,765 --> 00:02:11,567
Winston has the president's ear.

57
00:02:11,601 --> 00:02:12,801
Oh, I get it,

58
00:02:12,836 --> 00:02:14,970
but I got to be honest, Philip...

59
00:02:15,005 --> 00:02:16,772
it's a little out there.

60
00:02:16,806 --> 00:02:18,507
I know from reading the "Times"

61
00:02:18,542 --> 00:02:21,277
that China's got the tip of
its dick in the Congo...

62
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:24,346
And you want Winston

63
00:02:24,381 --> 00:02:26,448
to tell Obama to look the other way

64
00:02:26,483 --> 00:02:27,683
while the chinks fuck it dry.

65
00:02:27,717 --> 00:02:28,951
I mean...

66
00:02:28,985 --> 00:02:30,319
I don't know, to give them

67
00:02:30,353 --> 00:02:33,656
national sovereignty of another nation?

68
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:36,759
It's a little out
there, don't you think?

69
00:02:36,793 --> 00:02:38,661
Central Africa's a shit show.

70
00:02:38,695 --> 00:02:41,130
After climate change,

71
00:02:41,164 --> 00:02:43,265
it'll be a bunch of soon-to-be corpses

72
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:45,000
raging a civil war.

73
00:02:45,035 --> 00:02:46,702
The Oval Office could spin this

74
00:02:46,736 --> 00:02:50,005
as a humanitarian intervention.

75
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,273
Well, all due respect,

76
00:02:51,308 --> 00:02:52,508
it's bullshit.

77
00:02:52,542 --> 00:02:53,776
If he tells the ambassador

78
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:55,110
to vote "yes" on this,

79
00:02:55,145 --> 00:02:57,780
Obama will be forever known

80
00:02:57,814 --> 00:03:02,318
as the man who gifted Africa to China.

81
00:03:02,352 --> 00:03:03,886
No.

82
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:06,055
That's the fine point.

83
00:03:06,089 --> 00:03:09,391
Obama just needs to tell his ambassador

84
00:03:09,426 --> 00:03:13,062
to abstain.

85
00:03:13,096 --> 00:03:16,231
I, uh... I don't suppose

86
00:03:16,266 --> 00:03:17,967
you're gonna tell me

87
00:03:18,001 --> 00:03:21,003
what all this has to do
with your ambitions.

88
00:03:22,706 --> 00:03:24,673
Do this for me, Terry...

89
00:03:27,577 --> 00:03:30,379
And I promise I won't forget your help.

90
00:03:41,358 --> 00:03:43,325
I mean, the fucking Congo.

91
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,194
You know, the Congo.

92
00:03:45,228 --> 00:03:47,563
I mean, is there a pocket of the world

93
00:03:47,597 --> 00:03:49,231
you don't have your hand in?

94
00:03:49,265 --> 00:03:52,768
You're trading countries like, uh...
like playing cards.

95
00:03:52,802 --> 00:03:55,237
Isn't that what history is all about?

96
00:03:55,271 --> 00:03:59,174
Politically, economically,
geographically...

97
00:03:59,209 --> 00:04:03,412
imaginary lines being drawn and redrawn,

98
00:04:03,446 --> 00:04:05,948
over and over again?

99
00:04:08,418 --> 00:04:09,852
Yeah.

100
00:04:09,886 --> 00:04:14,089
Um, Philip, I got to know.

101
00:04:16,426 --> 00:04:17,693
What do you do it for?

102
00:04:17,727 --> 00:04:20,229
I mean, all of it?

103
00:04:24,934 --> 00:04:26,869
Honestly?

104
00:04:26,903 --> 00:04:28,103
Yeah.

105
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:39,415
In my life, as I was making my way,

106
00:04:39,449 --> 00:04:42,217
I always asked the question,

107
00:04:42,252 --> 00:04:47,156
am I the most powerful
person in the room?

108
00:04:49,359 --> 00:04:52,061
The answer needed to be yes.

109
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:55,497
To this day,

110
00:04:55,532 --> 00:04:58,667
I still ask that question.

111
00:04:58,702 --> 00:05:01,670
And the answer is still yes.

112
00:05:01,705 --> 00:05:05,574
In every room in the entire world,

113
00:05:05,608 --> 00:05:09,411
the answer is yes...

114
00:05:11,214 --> 00:05:15,150
With the exception of one.

115
00:05:15,185 --> 00:05:19,088
Or two.

116
00:05:19,122 --> 00:05:21,824
And that drives me.

117
00:05:24,561 --> 00:05:27,830
I intend to leave a legacy,

118
00:05:27,864 --> 00:05:31,767
the standard of which was set by God

119
00:05:31,801 --> 00:05:34,169
when he created the Earth

120
00:05:34,204 --> 00:05:38,006
and man after his own image.

121
00:05:43,546 --> 00:05:47,382
Anything less is...

122
00:05:47,417 --> 00:05:49,184
not worth mentioning.

124
00:06:53,116 --> 00:06:56,018
I'm still against this.

125
00:06:56,052 --> 00:06:57,519
The feds see us with him,

126
00:06:57,554 --> 00:06:59,521
no telling what conclusion they'll draw.

127
00:06:59,556 --> 00:07:02,391
If you had done the job
you were tasked with,

128
00:07:02,425 --> 00:07:05,327
we wouldn't be here.

129
00:07:18,508 --> 00:07:20,242
He's coming.

130
00:07:32,021 --> 00:07:33,288
Hello, Ollie.

131
00:07:47,503 --> 00:07:50,339
<i>Why isn't she saying anything?</i>

132
00:07:50,373 --> 00:07:53,408
<i>Is she trying to get inside my head?</i>

133
00:08:00,984 --> 00:08:02,851
<i>I still feel like she can hear us.</i>

134
00:08:04,454 --> 00:08:05,921
I feel like she can see me.

135
00:08:05,955 --> 00:08:07,723
You're not going anywhere.

136
00:08:10,493 --> 00:08:13,262
I know you're working with my husband.

137
00:08:13,296 --> 00:08:16,331
Tell me where he is.

138
00:08:16,366 --> 00:08:20,035
Sorry, I don't know.

139
00:08:23,373 --> 00:08:27,109
You're being honest this time.

140
00:08:27,143 --> 00:08:29,978
But you're gonna find him for me.

141
00:08:30,013 --> 00:08:33,282
No one's gonna find him.

142
00:08:33,316 --> 00:08:36,184
I don't think I'll be able to do that.

143
00:08:37,654 --> 00:08:40,155
Now you're back to lying.

144
00:08:40,189 --> 00:08:42,724
<i>Should I tell her the truth?</i>

145
00:08:42,759 --> 00:08:46,662
<i>Should I tell her that
her husband's dead?</i>

146
00:08:46,696 --> 00:08:50,432
You do that, I can guarantee we
don't walk out of here alive.

147
00:08:54,704 --> 00:08:58,006
On my first date with Tyrell,

148
00:08:58,041 --> 00:09:00,375
I saw this stunning redhead

149
00:09:00,410 --> 00:09:05,180
wearing a pair of cubic
zirconia earrings.

150
00:09:05,214 --> 00:09:09,484
I asked him what he would do
to get me those earrings.

151
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:13,889
He told me he would do
whatever was necessary.

152
00:09:13,923 --> 00:09:17,926
I told him I wanted him
to fuck that woman

153
00:09:17,961 --> 00:09:20,062
and bring me her earrings.

154
00:09:23,599 --> 00:09:25,701
The next morning,

155
00:09:25,735 --> 00:09:27,703
I woke up to a gift.

156
00:09:31,808 --> 00:09:35,110
These are the cheapest things I own,

157
00:09:35,144 --> 00:09:38,613
yet they're my favorite.

158
00:09:38,648 --> 00:09:41,783
Tyrell would always do
what was necessary.

159
00:09:41,818 --> 00:09:43,685
And at the end of that,

160
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,587
I would receive a gift.

161
00:09:45,621 --> 00:09:49,391
That's why I know he's alive.

162
00:09:49,425 --> 00:09:51,560
That's why he's been calling me...

163
00:09:54,998 --> 00:09:57,799
That's why he sent me this phone...

164
00:10:01,404 --> 00:10:05,741
Because he's doing what's necessary.

165
00:10:05,775 --> 00:10:07,609
You talked to him?

166
00:10:11,948 --> 00:10:14,249
He called me last night.

167
00:10:14,283 --> 00:10:16,818
<i>That's impossible.</i>

168
00:10:16,853 --> 00:10:19,254
He wants to let me know that he's okay.

169
00:10:19,288 --> 00:10:21,723
He has a plan.

170
00:10:21,758 --> 00:10:23,925
He told you that?

171
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:26,428
No.

172
00:10:26,462 --> 00:10:28,563
We haven't spoken.

173
00:10:28,598 --> 00:10:30,966
He's protecting me.

174
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,101
That's what you do for your partner.

175
00:10:38,274 --> 00:10:40,509
The calls come up as unknown.

176
00:10:40,543 --> 00:10:42,978
I've tried to have him
tracked, but I've been...

177
00:10:43,012 --> 00:10:45,647
unsuccessful.

178
00:10:45,681 --> 00:10:48,316
Is this something you might
be able to accomplish?

179
00:10:50,219 --> 00:10:53,422
This bitch is blood simple, Elliot.

180
00:10:53,456 --> 00:10:56,158
She's the wife of the psycho
who strangled that woman...

181
00:10:56,192 --> 00:10:59,828
the same psycho who is this
close to doing the same to you.

182
00:10:59,862 --> 00:11:02,597
If we're around when she
learns that Tyrell is dead,

183
00:11:02,632 --> 00:11:05,000
you don't think she'll have us killed?

184
00:11:05,034 --> 00:11:06,701
<i>He's right.</i>

185
00:11:06,736 --> 00:11:08,403
<i>It's not worth it.</i>

186
00:11:12,909 --> 00:11:16,812
I'm sorry.

187
00:11:16,846 --> 00:11:18,246
Can't help you.

188
00:11:49,445 --> 00:11:52,347
Do you really want to say no to me?

189
00:12:05,351 --> 00:12:06,937
I mean, where did he come from?

190
00:12:06,953 --> 00:12:08,601
I found him gasping on the couch.

191
00:12:08,812 --> 00:12:10,124
And you brought him here?

192
00:12:10,164 --> 00:12:11,898
I wasn't gonna fuckin' leave him there.

193
00:12:11,932 --> 00:12:14,067
He was saying your name; I
figured he was one of your guys.

194
00:12:14,101 --> 00:12:17,103
Vincent. Vincent!

195
00:12:21,905 --> 00:12:23,373
What is wrong with him?

196
00:12:23,407 --> 00:12:25,708
How am I supposed to know?

197
00:12:25,744 --> 00:12:26,977
Where are the others?

198
00:12:27,012 --> 00:12:28,212
He was the only one there.

199
00:12:28,246 --> 00:12:30,014
I had to cab it straight back here.

200
00:12:30,048 --> 00:12:32,549
Who the fuck is this guy?

201
00:12:32,584 --> 00:12:35,753
He was one of the D.C. guys
who did the Capitol Hill job.

202
00:12:35,787 --> 00:12:38,722
We got to get this guy to a hospital.

203
00:12:38,757 --> 00:12:41,225
No hospitals.

204
00:12:41,259 --> 00:12:43,394
How do we know he doesn't
have a tracker on him

205
00:12:43,428 --> 00:12:44,695
or a bug?

206
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,967
Jesus.

207
00:12:51,636 --> 00:12:54,505
That looks like internal bleeding.

208
00:12:54,539 --> 00:12:56,273
This guy's gonna die.

209
00:12:56,307 --> 00:13:01,211
All we got to do is
drop him off at an ER.

210
00:13:03,381 --> 00:13:06,383
He knows my face...

211
00:13:06,418 --> 00:13:08,018
my name.

212
00:13:08,053 --> 00:13:10,220
He's gonna wake up to
a drip of morphine.

213
00:13:10,255 --> 00:13:13,057
I can't risk him talking.

214
00:13:13,091 --> 00:13:15,125
And what?

215
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:18,095
He knew what he was
getting himself into.

216
00:13:18,129 --> 00:13:20,230
If we don't get him help right now,

217
00:13:20,265 --> 00:13:22,232
he's gonna die.

218
00:13:22,267 --> 00:13:25,302
How does that not compute for you?

219
00:13:25,336 --> 00:13:28,472
Our focus is finding Trenton and Mobley.

220
00:13:28,506 --> 00:13:31,775
Trenton and Mobley
might already be dead!

221
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:35,412
Jesus, you're completely
fucking losing it!

222
00:13:35,447 --> 00:13:37,481
You wanna act like
you're on top of things,

223
00:13:37,515 --> 00:13:38,816
but you're not.

224
00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:41,051
You're buried way underneath.

225
00:13:41,086 --> 00:13:42,553
You're not a leader.

226
00:13:42,587 --> 00:13:44,555
You're not special.

227
00:13:44,589 --> 00:13:46,924
Yeah, you guys did the hack,
but you fumbled your way

228
00:13:46,958 --> 00:13:48,625
into this ridiculous freak accident.

229
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:49,893
That ain't leading!

230
00:13:49,928 --> 00:13:52,463
It's time to drop the charade

231
00:13:52,497 --> 00:13:53,964
like this was all part of the plan

232
00:13:53,998 --> 00:13:56,533
and wake the fuck up!

233
00:14:01,806 --> 00:14:04,508
There's no way that you can
justify letting him die.

234
00:14:24,028 --> 00:14:26,697
Where's Agent Yang?

235
00:14:26,731 --> 00:14:28,465
Excuse me?

236
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:29,666
Agent Yang?

237
00:14:29,701 --> 00:14:30,667
Back there.

238
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:35,706
Yes, yeah, yeah, that's correct.

239
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:36,974
It's no court.

240
00:14:37,008 --> 00:14:38,709
Yeah, I got it. I got it.

241
00:14:38,743 --> 00:14:40,144
Do we know the ETA on that?

242
00:14:40,178 --> 00:14:41,812
I'm sorry, conference call.

243
00:14:41,846 --> 00:14:43,046
Can you believe this house?

244
00:14:43,081 --> 00:14:44,848
Mm, yup, sure is real nice.

245
00:14:44,883 --> 00:14:47,384
We should seriously consider
pooling our money together.

246
00:14:47,418 --> 00:14:50,120
It's probably going to
be on the market soon.

247
00:14:50,155 --> 00:14:51,989
So what happened here exactly?

248
00:14:52,023 --> 00:14:54,191
I was told it had something to
do with the D.C. activists.

249
00:14:54,225 --> 00:14:55,626
Teabaggers, yeah.

250
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:57,294
They were found two
days ago in Maryland.

251
00:14:57,328 --> 00:14:59,296
A car chase ensued. Ended badly.

252
00:14:59,330 --> 00:15:01,532
One got away; the rest were apprehended.

253
00:15:01,566 --> 00:15:03,500
This is where they
were supposed to meet.

254
00:15:03,535 --> 00:15:05,002
Owner's an E Corp lawyer.

255
00:15:05,036 --> 00:15:06,537
Supposed to be on vacation.

256
00:15:06,571 --> 00:15:10,007
Starting to look more
like she's missing.

257
00:15:10,041 --> 00:15:12,376
I'm sorry, hon, I'm
still not entirely sure

258
00:15:12,410 --> 00:15:13,677
why I was called here.

259
00:15:16,247 --> 00:15:18,315
That's from someone three doors down.

260
00:15:18,349 --> 00:15:19,850
He was seen here.

261
00:15:19,884 --> 00:15:22,019
He and another male were
spotted around 10:00 p.m.

262
00:15:22,053 --> 00:15:23,420
getting into a cab.

263
00:15:23,454 --> 00:15:25,255
The description matches
a person of interest

264
00:15:25,290 --> 00:15:26,857
in your code name case.

265
00:15:28,092 --> 00:15:31,261
Wait, he was here tonight?

266
00:15:31,296 --> 00:15:33,096
Have you found the cab?

267
00:15:33,131 --> 00:15:35,165
If this is really the guy,
why did we burn the house?

268
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,433
How come we didn't put
surveillance on it?

269
00:15:36,467 --> 00:15:38,101
What was the thought process here?

270
00:15:38,136 --> 00:15:39,870
You know Director Comey's
taking a more aggressive

271
00:15:39,904 --> 00:15:42,039
strategy on everything ever
since the shit hit the fan

272
00:15:42,073 --> 00:15:44,041
over that video.

273
00:15:45,004 --> 00:15:47,105
Yeah.

274
00:15:47,130 --> 00:15:50,332
I can walk you through the
report if we need to.

275
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:52,667
Uh, check with Agent Burke, yes.

276
00:16:04,349 --> 00:16:05,416
<i>Is this the future</i>

277
00:16:05,450 --> 00:16:06,817
<i>I was fighting for?</i>

278
00:16:11,156 --> 00:16:14,992
<i>The system is hung,</i>

279
00:16:15,026 --> 00:16:17,228
<i>frozen in limbo.</i>

280
00:16:20,599 --> 00:16:22,900
<i>Did we lose the fight?</i>

281
00:16:22,934 --> 00:16:25,636
<i>Maybe wars aren't meant to be won.</i>

282
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:28,906
<i>Maybe they're meant to be continuous.</i>

283
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:32,143
<i>Maybe Ray had it right all along.</i>

284
00:16:32,177 --> 00:16:34,779
These people are certifiable.

285
00:16:36,381 --> 00:16:37,648
You should be going home,

286
00:16:37,682 --> 00:16:40,651
not working with these wack jobs.

287
00:16:40,685 --> 00:16:42,520
She's a grieving wife.

288
00:16:42,551 --> 00:16:44,421
She wants to believe he's alive.

289
00:16:48,226 --> 00:16:50,594
Who do you think's making those calls?

290
00:16:50,629 --> 00:16:52,329
Her husband's
the most wanted man

291
00:16:52,364 --> 00:16:54,265
in the country.

292
00:16:54,299 --> 00:16:57,134
A ton of people hate her
just by association.

293
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:04,942
We need to stop at Micro Center.

294
00:17:04,976 --> 00:17:07,444
We're only making one stop:

295
00:17:07,479 --> 00:17:08,946
your apartment.

296
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:11,282
The cops confiscated everything;

297
00:17:11,316 --> 00:17:13,884
it'll be weeks before I can get it back.

298
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:16,287
If you want this done tonight,

299
00:17:16,321 --> 00:17:18,255
I need hardware.

300
00:17:41,016 --> 00:17:43,583
This is a composite from
Ollie Parker's testimony.

301
00:17:47,354 --> 00:17:48,988
This is a sketch from a
description a neighbor

302
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:51,724
gave us just now at
Susan Jacobs's house.

303
00:17:51,759 --> 00:17:53,660
These are from two separate witnesses.

304
00:17:53,694 --> 00:17:55,695
This is the same guy.

305
00:17:59,333 --> 00:18:00,800
We have fresh evidence on this guy.

306
00:18:00,835 --> 00:18:02,268
He's not tainted.

307
00:18:05,673 --> 00:18:08,508
We're gonna put out a BOLO.

308
00:18:08,542 --> 00:18:10,243
If you do that, the Dark
Army will kill him.

309
00:18:10,277 --> 00:18:11,444
Not this again.

310
00:18:11,478 --> 00:18:12,745
If this sketch gets on the news,

311
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:15,114
he's as good as dead.

312
00:18:15,149 --> 00:18:16,449
I'm telling you, they won't
let one of their own

313
00:18:16,483 --> 00:18:18,484
be known by law enforcement like that.

314
00:18:18,519 --> 00:18:21,654
As it is now, they might already know.

315
00:18:21,689 --> 00:18:24,090
We lost Sunil Markesh.

316
00:18:24,124 --> 00:18:25,491
We can't let it happen with this guy.

317
00:18:25,526 --> 00:18:27,093
Just give me...

318
00:18:27,127 --> 00:18:28,494
Dom?

319
00:18:28,529 --> 00:18:31,331
We're going to the media for this one.

320
00:18:31,365 --> 00:18:33,132
And we're using this.

321
00:18:37,071 --> 00:18:40,206
Look, this whole, slow roll

322
00:18:40,241 --> 00:18:41,808
that you and the rest of
us have been working up,

323
00:18:41,842 --> 00:18:43,710
it didn't work.

324
00:18:43,744 --> 00:18:46,813
It's time to embrace the
Bureau's new direction.

325
00:18:51,252 --> 00:18:53,219
Yeah, it's Santiago.

326
00:18:53,254 --> 00:18:57,156
Well, tell him I need him right away.

327
00:18:57,191 --> 00:18:59,292
Dom...

328
00:18:59,326 --> 00:19:02,896
I have Agent Thomas looking
into cab companies.

329
00:19:02,930 --> 00:19:06,866
He may have found a lead
to where this guy went.

330
00:19:06,901 --> 00:19:08,134
Hook up with him.

331
00:19:11,171 --> 00:19:16,409
<i>A cryptocurrency regulated by Evil Corp.</i>

332
00:19:16,443 --> 00:19:19,979
The hypocrisy isn't surprising.

333
00:19:20,014 --> 00:19:23,349
A special Evil Corp discount
if we use their new money.

334
00:19:23,384 --> 00:19:25,818
If you ever needed a sign that
our work is not done yet,

335
00:19:25,853 --> 00:19:27,120
this is it.

336
00:19:40,734 --> 00:19:42,502
Even if you track the
call to some crank yanker

337
00:19:42,536 --> 00:19:45,038
down the street, when you give
him the info, you should...

338
00:19:45,072 --> 00:19:47,440
Place the call far away.

339
00:19:47,474 --> 00:19:49,208
Like another country far.

340
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:00,586
<i>The phone.</i>

341
00:20:00,621 --> 00:20:03,289
<i>It's the one Joanna gave me.</i>

342
00:20:09,063 --> 00:20:10,930
Hello?

343
00:20:24,011 --> 00:20:26,245
<i>Tell me you heard that too.</i>

344
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:28,081
<i>It can't be him, can it?</i>

345
00:20:29,583 --> 00:20:32,051
<i>And why is Mr. Robot suddenly gone?</i>

346
00:20:48,509 --> 00:20:50,143
Keep going.

347
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:55,682
Elliot? What does he have
to do with stage two?

348
00:20:57,702 --> 00:20:59,770
I was hoping you could tell me.

349
00:21:10,108 --> 00:21:11,909
I could've just dropped
him off at the door.

350
00:21:11,943 --> 00:21:15,679
- You didn't have to...
- I couldn't just leave him.

351
00:21:15,714 --> 00:21:17,481
I needed to be here.

352
00:21:21,086 --> 00:21:22,653
You were right back there.

353
00:21:25,256 --> 00:21:29,259
I'm not special.

354
00:21:29,294 --> 00:21:32,296
It's Elliot.

355
00:21:32,330 --> 00:21:35,366
He's the one with the plan...

356
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:38,235
the one they're taking seriously.

357
00:21:50,648 --> 00:21:52,583
<i>You know, I always thought it was crazy</i>

358
00:21:52,617 --> 00:21:54,084
<i>we got away with this.</i>

359
00:21:57,022 --> 00:21:59,223
I thought there was
something special about me

360
00:21:59,257 --> 00:22:01,458
that made it happen.

361
00:22:01,493 --> 00:22:03,394
<i>But it wasn't me,</i>

362
00:22:03,428 --> 00:22:06,764
<i>Mobley, Trenton, or Romero.</i>

363
00:22:06,798 --> 00:22:08,465
It was him.

364
00:22:10,502 --> 00:22:13,070
It's always been him.

365
00:22:13,104 --> 00:22:14,304
When I was five,

366
00:22:14,339 --> 00:22:17,775
our parents took us to Coney Island,

367
00:22:17,809 --> 00:22:20,744
my dad's idea of an
Alderson family outing.

368
00:22:20,779 --> 00:22:21,945
What are you doing?

369
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:23,414
Making a high-powered antenna.

370
00:22:23,448 --> 00:22:27,818
I need to piggyback off
someone else's wifi.

371
00:22:27,852 --> 00:22:30,421
I remember looking up
at this roller coaster

372
00:22:30,455 --> 00:22:32,790
thinking it was the highest
thing I had ever seen.

373
00:22:38,997 --> 00:22:43,434
Of course, I wasn't tall
enough to go on it,

374
00:22:43,468 --> 00:22:46,303
<i>so my dad went with Elliot,</i>

375
00:22:46,337 --> 00:22:49,440
and I had to wait with my mom.

376
00:22:49,474 --> 00:22:53,644
<i>I don't remember exactly
what happened next,</i>

377
00:22:53,678 --> 00:22:57,347
but somehow I got lost.

378
00:22:57,382 --> 00:22:59,183
You know, most kids get scared shitless

379
00:22:59,217 --> 00:23:01,852
when they're alone, but I wasn't.

380
00:23:01,886 --> 00:23:04,988
I loved it.

381
00:23:05,023 --> 00:23:07,658
All of a sudden, I felt...

382
00:23:07,692 --> 00:23:10,561
someone grab me around the
waist and pick me up.

383
00:23:12,397 --> 00:23:15,499
It was this old woman.

384
00:23:15,533 --> 00:23:17,901
She was skinny and tall.

385
00:23:17,936 --> 00:23:22,072
She had this smeared,
almost pink lipstick.

386
00:23:24,209 --> 00:23:26,543
She held on to me tight.

387
00:23:26,578 --> 00:23:28,145
<i>I thought about screaming,</i>

388
00:23:28,179 --> 00:23:29,913
<i>but I didn't.</i>

389
00:23:31,249 --> 00:23:32,983
I didn't want to.

390
00:23:37,589 --> 00:23:39,256
<i>We went to Nathan's,</i>

391
00:23:39,290 --> 00:23:43,360
<i>and she said that I could
have whatever I wanted.</i>

392
00:23:43,394 --> 00:23:46,563
My parents never asked
me what I wanted...

393
00:23:46,598 --> 00:23:47,998
<i>ever.</i>

394
00:23:48,032 --> 00:23:49,700
<i>It was the first time I ever</i>

395
00:23:49,734 --> 00:23:52,035
<i>really felt special.</i>

396
00:23:52,070 --> 00:23:54,004
<i>We started driving to her house,</i>

397
00:23:54,038 --> 00:23:56,440
and...

398
00:23:56,474 --> 00:23:58,442
I definitely remember thinking

399
00:23:58,476 --> 00:24:00,043
that something wasn't right,

400
00:24:00,078 --> 00:24:03,280
but I just looked at
her and her lipstick

401
00:24:03,314 --> 00:24:05,349
<i>and let it happen.</i>

402
00:24:05,383 --> 00:24:09,453
And then we got to her house,
and she showed me my room,

403
00:24:09,487 --> 00:24:12,022
and it had one of those beds

404
00:24:12,056 --> 00:24:15,225
with the curtains around it.

405
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:17,394
And I did feel like a princess.

406
00:24:17,428 --> 00:24:20,697
<i>I remember thinking that
this was my new home</i>

407
00:24:20,732 --> 00:24:22,900
and my new life, and I didn't

408
00:24:22,934 --> 00:24:24,968
have to see my parents ever again.

409
00:24:25,003 --> 00:24:28,238
<i>It was like a wish I had that
all of a sudden came true.</i>

410
00:24:28,273 --> 00:24:31,308
And I went to sleep just hoping

411
00:24:31,342 --> 00:24:33,810
that this wasn't all a dream,

412
00:24:33,845 --> 00:24:36,380
and I wasn't just gonna
wake up in my old bed.

413
00:24:38,416 --> 00:24:40,217
And sure enough, the next morning,

414
00:24:40,251 --> 00:24:42,219
I was still there.

415
00:24:42,253 --> 00:24:45,622
<i>But then the police barged in.</i>

416
00:24:45,657 --> 00:24:47,324
And when they took me downstairs,

417
00:24:47,358 --> 00:24:48,959
there were cops everywhere.

418
00:24:51,329 --> 00:24:53,830
I didn't even get to
see the woman again.

419
00:24:56,801 --> 00:25:01,004
And then they put me in their car

420
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:05,776
and took me home.

421
00:25:05,810 --> 00:25:07,778
I still wonder what my
life would've been like

422
00:25:07,812 --> 00:25:11,615
if I had stayed.

423
00:25:11,649 --> 00:25:13,784
<i>But if I had stayed...</i>

424
00:25:17,889 --> 00:25:20,023
Then I wouldn't have Elliot.

425
00:25:25,296 --> 00:25:27,531
There are a lot of guys working on this.

426
00:25:27,565 --> 00:25:30,934
None of them can figure it out.

427
00:25:30,969 --> 00:25:32,369
What's that for?

428
00:25:32,403 --> 00:25:35,472
For impersonating an NYPD officer.

429
00:25:35,506 --> 00:25:38,208
All cell carriers have a
law enforcement hotline.

430
00:25:38,243 --> 00:25:39,476
Instead of hacking the carrier,

431
00:25:39,510 --> 00:25:41,345
if the situation's urgent enough,

432
00:25:41,379 --> 00:25:43,647
you can just ask them to track
a blocked call for you.

433
00:26:13,444 --> 00:26:14,544
Is it done?

434
00:26:16,881 --> 00:26:18,548
Not yet...

435
00:26:18,583 --> 00:26:21,084
need a few minutes for the
spoof fax to go through.

436
00:26:21,119 --> 00:26:24,187
It needs to propagate
through their system.

437
00:26:24,222 --> 00:26:27,691
No one in the world uses
fax anymore except cops.

438
00:26:30,595 --> 00:26:34,264
Half of me wants it to be him.

439
00:26:34,299 --> 00:26:35,832
Half of me doesn't.

440
00:26:39,404 --> 00:26:42,205
Before working for the Wellicks,
I had a list of clients,

441
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:45,342
all of them eccentric
in one form or another.

442
00:26:45,376 --> 00:26:47,277
I worked for this one guy

443
00:26:47,312 --> 00:26:50,547
who used to masturbate in the car.

444
00:26:50,581 --> 00:26:53,050
He used to have me drop
him off at Carnegie Hall.

445
00:26:53,084 --> 00:26:58,088
He was a first chair violinist

446
00:26:58,122 --> 00:27:00,257
<i>God, now he wants to have</i>

447
00:27:00,291 --> 00:27:02,559
<i>a heart-to-heart.</i>

448
00:27:02,593 --> 00:27:04,728
<i>Focusing on you helps drown him out...</i>

449
00:27:04,762 --> 00:27:08,231
One of those, uh, Stradivarius
violins from the 1700s.

450
00:27:08,266 --> 00:27:10,867
<i>Like talking to someone
in a crowded restaurant.</i>

451
00:27:10,902 --> 00:27:12,402
Take it everywhere with him...

452
00:27:12,437 --> 00:27:13,704
<i>All the other voices and noises</i>

453
00:27:13,738 --> 00:27:15,472
<i>fade into the background.</i>

454
00:27:15,506 --> 00:27:18,542
<i>Somehow your brain is able
to decode the components</i>

455
00:27:18,576 --> 00:27:20,977
<i>of that complex auditory space.</i>

456
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:24,648
<i>Can you feel it?</i>

457
00:27:24,682 --> 00:27:27,551
<i>Good. That gives us time to talk.</i>

458
00:27:29,420 --> 00:27:32,723
<i>Is Mr. Robot MIA because he's afraid?</i>

459
00:27:32,757 --> 00:27:36,093
<i>Afraid of what I might find
when I'm done with this hack?</i>

460
00:27:37,495 --> 00:27:40,163
<i>Why did that phone call freak him out?</i>

461
00:27:40,198 --> 00:27:42,966
<i>Could he have lied about Tyrell?</i>

462
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,402
<i>What's his move here?</i>

463
00:27:45,436 --> 00:27:47,971
<i>Do you remember the
last thing he wanted?</i>

464
00:27:48,005 --> 00:27:50,774
<i>He kept wanting to come
back home, remember?</i>

465
00:27:50,808 --> 00:27:54,177
<i>There must be something
here that he needs.</i>

466
00:27:54,212 --> 00:27:57,781
<i>He's been bringing it up
since we left prison.</i>

467
00:27:57,815 --> 00:28:00,784
<i>Can you help?</i>

468
00:28:00,818 --> 00:28:03,487
<i>Can you look?</i>

469
00:28:03,521 --> 00:28:05,555
<i>Do you see anything?</i>

470
00:28:20,304 --> 00:28:22,272
And now they're moving to the next step.

471
00:28:22,306 --> 00:28:23,807
Yes, the next step.

472
00:28:23,841 --> 00:28:25,041
You know what the next step is?

473
00:28:25,076 --> 00:28:26,143
Blackouts. Why?

474
00:28:26,177 --> 00:28:27,811
So they can take away your power,

475
00:28:27,845 --> 00:28:31,648
and I am not talking
about your electricity.

476
00:28:31,682 --> 00:28:33,450
I'm talking about your computers,

477
00:28:33,484 --> 00:28:36,686
your access to the Internet,
your television, your phone.

478
00:28:36,721 --> 00:28:38,054
<i>What does that all add up to?</i>

479
00:28:38,089 --> 00:28:40,123
<i>Information.</i>

480
00:28:40,158 --> 00:28:41,491
Those wounds aren't fresh.

481
00:28:41,526 --> 00:28:43,994
Do you have any idea
what happened to him?

482
00:28:44,028 --> 00:28:45,629
<i>- It puts them in control.
- Uh, we...</i>

483
00:28:45,663 --> 00:28:48,632
we went over to his place
and found him like that.

484
00:28:48,666 --> 00:28:50,333
Is he gonna be all right?

485
00:28:50,368 --> 00:28:52,302
He's on a respirator.

486
00:28:52,336 --> 00:28:53,537
They're gonna do a CT scan

487
00:28:53,571 --> 00:28:55,005
and run some other tests.

488
00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:56,873
We should know more in
about an hour or so.

489
00:28:56,908 --> 00:28:58,675
- Okay.
- Thank you.

490
00:29:03,581 --> 00:29:08,051
Well, we got an hour to kill.

491
00:29:08,085 --> 00:29:09,486
Hungry?

492
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:11,254
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

493
00:29:13,958 --> 00:29:17,160
<i>Hi, this is Detective
Richard Hannigan, NYPD,</i>

494
00:29:17,195 --> 00:29:21,231
11th precinct, badge number 22350.

495
00:29:21,265 --> 00:29:23,500
I just faxed over an exigent form

496
00:29:23,534 --> 00:29:24,734
for a suicidal person.

497
00:29:24,769 --> 00:29:26,503
Can you confirm that you received it?

498
00:29:26,537 --> 00:29:28,939
Yeah, I got a guy who called
his girlfriend's cell

499
00:29:28,973 --> 00:29:31,675
saying he's gonna shoot himself.

500
00:29:31,709 --> 00:29:35,345
Yeah, all of them came in blocked.

501
00:29:35,379 --> 00:29:38,949
Perfect, can you see
if it's one of yours?

502
00:29:38,983 --> 00:29:41,618
Can you ping that phone
for a current location?

503
00:29:44,646 --> 00:29:47,215
_

504
00:29:47,258 --> 00:29:48,959
You've been a huge help.

505
00:29:48,993 --> 00:29:51,394
I'll call you if there's something else.

506
00:30:04,494 --> 00:30:06,822
_

507
00:30:08,151 --> 00:30:10,831
_

508
00:30:12,183 --> 00:30:13,450
Got it.

509
00:30:19,457 --> 00:30:20,790
Goddamn it.

510
00:30:24,462 --> 00:30:26,763
Is that where the phone is right now?

511
00:30:26,797 --> 00:30:28,598
Within 12 meters.

512
00:30:39,043 --> 00:30:40,043
Is it him?

513
00:30:49,987 --> 00:30:50,987
Clear.

514
00:30:51,022 --> 00:30:52,255
Clear!

515
00:31:04,235 --> 00:31:05,702
Trust me,

516
00:31:05,736 --> 00:31:07,771
he wouldn't be calling from that house.

517
00:31:37,535 --> 00:31:41,171
<i>Has issued a BOLO on the man
pictured in this sketch.</i>

518
00:31:41,205 --> 00:31:43,006
<i>Given FBI cyber involvement,</i>

519
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:44,341
<i>we can only speculate at this time</i>

520
00:31:44,375 --> 00:31:46,242
<i>that the man in this sketch</i>

521
00:31:46,277 --> 00:31:49,546
<i>may be wanted in relation to
the infamous Five/Nine attack.</i>

522
00:32:01,785 --> 00:32:04,199
_

523
00:32:08,050 --> 00:32:10,964
<i>I have money stashed at
a hackerspace on Canal.</i>

524
00:32:10,989 --> 00:32:12,623
<i>Okay, we make sure Vincent's all right.</i>

525
00:32:12,954 --> 00:32:14,821
We wipe your place down,
and then we bolt.

526
00:32:14,856 --> 00:32:16,089
We can target them from afar

527
00:32:16,124 --> 00:32:17,591
for more intel on Trenton and Mobley.

528
00:32:17,625 --> 00:32:21,261
Darlene, you know we can't leave.

529
00:32:21,296 --> 00:32:23,330
They don't own us.

530
00:32:23,364 --> 00:32:24,798
We played by their rules,

531
00:32:24,832 --> 00:32:26,967
and those fuckers still
hit Trenton and Mobley.

532
00:32:31,673 --> 00:32:33,840
I am so sick

533
00:32:33,875 --> 00:32:36,276
of always worry about switching cabs

534
00:32:36,311 --> 00:32:38,779
and phones and trains and
always looking behind...

535
00:32:38,813 --> 00:32:40,781
Just calm down, okay?

536
00:32:42,183 --> 00:32:43,450
He was waiting here?

537
00:32:43,484 --> 00:32:45,319
- Yeah, they were...
- They?

538
00:32:45,353 --> 00:32:46,887
Who was he with? Male or female?

539
00:32:46,921 --> 00:32:49,122
Dom, we're reviewing
the security footage.

540
00:32:49,157 --> 00:32:50,123
Let her finish.

541
00:32:50,158 --> 00:32:51,558
A woman.

542
00:32:51,593 --> 00:32:53,627
His girlfriend, I think.

543
00:32:53,661 --> 00:32:55,295
They were waiting here.

544
00:32:55,330 --> 00:32:57,197
They were really concerned
about their friend.

545
00:32:57,231 --> 00:32:58,999
They waited for about an hour,

546
00:32:59,033 --> 00:33:01,468
and then I told them we were
sending him up for some tests.

547
00:33:01,502 --> 00:33:03,036
And that's when they left?

548
00:33:03,071 --> 00:33:05,739
I'm sorry, I wasn't paying attention.

549
00:33:05,773 --> 00:33:08,642
If it helps, I told them
to come back in an hour.

550
00:33:08,676 --> 00:33:12,646
At this point, they're
definitely not coming back here.

551
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:14,748
He probably saw the BOLO.

552
00:33:14,782 --> 00:33:16,883
He's freaking out. Probably hiding.

553
00:33:16,918 --> 00:33:19,519
It might take some time,
but we'll get him.

554
00:33:46,814 --> 00:33:48,749
I got your messages.

555
00:33:48,783 --> 00:33:50,951
Sorry it took so long to get here.

556
00:33:57,959 --> 00:34:01,895
What's wrong?

557
00:34:01,929 --> 00:34:04,798
Why did you start fsociety?

558
00:34:20,248 --> 00:34:22,416
I didn't want to involve you.

559
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:27,320
An FBI agent

560
00:34:27,355 --> 00:34:30,390
came to my place.

561
00:34:45,306 --> 00:34:46,640
Look, let's just sit here

562
00:34:46,674 --> 00:34:48,742
and chill a minute.

563
00:34:48,776 --> 00:34:51,278
Right? We'll come up with something.

564
00:34:51,312 --> 00:34:54,281
Sometimes...

565
00:34:54,315 --> 00:34:56,016
the best decision is not making one.

566
00:35:00,354 --> 00:35:01,455
Fine.

567
00:35:11,466 --> 00:35:13,266
Why'd it take you so long to call it in?

568
00:35:13,301 --> 00:35:14,501
The TV's right there.

569
00:35:16,671 --> 00:35:18,538
It's okay; you didn't do anything wrong.

570
00:35:18,573 --> 00:35:20,207
I'm just trying to figure something out.

571
00:35:21,976 --> 00:35:24,678
It's probably because
Janice turns it to the news

572
00:35:24,712 --> 00:35:26,113
when her shift starts.

573
00:35:31,986 --> 00:35:34,521
They didn't see it...

574
00:35:34,555 --> 00:35:38,391
the TV... they're coming back.

575
00:35:38,426 --> 00:35:40,127
They probably didn't go too far.

576
00:35:48,936 --> 00:35:50,570
I can fix this, okay?

577
00:35:50,605 --> 00:35:53,540
- I will fix...
- I'm gonna confess.

578
00:35:53,574 --> 00:35:55,308
I've already called my lawyer.

579
00:35:55,343 --> 00:35:59,045
I'm on my way to meet her now.

580
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:03,683
I can't keep pretending
like this is gonna go away.

581
00:36:03,718 --> 00:36:06,353
We can't beat them.

582
00:36:06,387 --> 00:36:08,321
Trust me, I've tried.

583
00:36:08,356 --> 00:36:10,223
No matter what we do,

584
00:36:10,258 --> 00:36:12,459
we will always lose to them.

585
00:36:15,797 --> 00:36:18,732
I'm gonna tell 'em that I
planted the femtocell.

586
00:36:24,438 --> 00:36:26,072
I would never involve any of you,

587
00:36:26,107 --> 00:36:28,275
so I'm just gonna own up for what I did.

588
00:36:28,309 --> 00:36:29,843
But sooner or later, Elliot,

589
00:36:29,877 --> 00:36:31,444
this will all catch up to you.

590
00:36:35,082 --> 00:36:36,950
Thank you.

591
00:36:36,984 --> 00:36:38,852
Ooh.

592
00:36:38,886 --> 00:36:41,221
What the fuck are you doing?

593
00:36:41,255 --> 00:36:42,422
What?

594
00:36:42,456 --> 00:36:43,523
If you wanted some,

595
00:36:43,558 --> 00:36:44,958
you should've ordered your own.

596
00:36:44,992 --> 00:36:46,893
You know I'm not into
that family-style shit.

597
00:36:46,928 --> 00:36:48,261
Oh. Oops.

598
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,101
You're such an asshole.

599
00:36:55,136 --> 00:36:57,470
<i>How am I supposed to help
the ones I care about</i>

600
00:36:57,505 --> 00:37:01,775
<i>when every step I take puts
them in greater danger?</i>

601
00:37:01,809 --> 00:37:03,610
<i>This was my plan,</i>

602
00:37:03,644 --> 00:37:06,079
<i>and I hid in a cage while everyone else</i>

603
00:37:06,113 --> 00:37:07,781
<i>took all the risk.</i>

604
00:37:07,815 --> 00:37:10,717
I mean, fuck.

605
00:37:10,751 --> 00:37:13,987
We have to talk to each
other on the subway.

606
00:37:14,021 --> 00:37:16,323
It's a long way from getting high

607
00:37:16,357 --> 00:37:18,725
and watching "Back to the Future II."

608
00:37:23,664 --> 00:37:26,166
Yeah, we never did get
around to doing that.

609
00:37:35,977 --> 00:37:37,444
Excuse me, have you seen a young couple

610
00:37:37,478 --> 00:37:39,112
walk past recently coming
from that direction?

611
00:37:39,146 --> 00:37:40,947
No, I didn't see anyone.

612
00:37:40,982 --> 00:37:43,650
She's got dark hair; he's
wearing a baseball hat.

613
00:37:47,288 --> 00:37:50,290
<i>Do you remember when I found
you at the Queens Museum?</i>

614
00:37:50,324 --> 00:37:52,626
You were pacing

615
00:37:52,660 --> 00:37:53,927
and screaming at the staff,

616
00:37:53,961 --> 00:37:55,161
because they couldn't see

617
00:37:55,196 --> 00:37:58,598
whoever you said you were seeing.

618
00:37:58,633 --> 00:38:01,034
Was it your dad then too,
or was it someone else?

619
00:38:07,074 --> 00:38:10,610
I don't remember that at all.

620
00:38:10,645 --> 00:38:13,513
Elliot, I don't know if you
started all this because of him.

621
00:38:13,547 --> 00:38:15,382
But whatever he is,

622
00:38:15,416 --> 00:38:18,118
you can't work with him.

623
00:38:18,152 --> 00:38:20,954
Don't trick yourself into thinking that.

624
00:38:27,995 --> 00:38:29,896
If I was gonna eat around
here, where would I go?

625
00:38:29,931 --> 00:38:31,398
There's nothing around here.

626
00:38:31,432 --> 00:38:33,166
You've got to go over,
like, five blocks.

627
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:34,901
There's still a few
places open over there.

628
00:39:00,895 --> 00:39:04,864
You should probably get off here.

629
00:39:22,149 --> 00:39:24,217
<i>I don't want to leave her.</i>

630
00:40:51,872 --> 00:40:54,307
Send all units to Watts and 6th Ave.

631
00:41:55,803 --> 00:41:57,770
Get down! Down on the ground!

632
00:42:00,141 --> 00:42:01,174
Green!

633
00:42:01,208 --> 00:42:02,909
Green! FBI!

634
00:42:02,943 --> 00:42:04,377
Don't shoot!

635
00:42:10,942 --> 00:42:14,044
