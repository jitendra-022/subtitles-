1
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:26,300
 Next round!

2
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:37,500
 Now that we've moved to paradise, there's nothing to eat.

3
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,500
 Speaking of moving, I forgot to congratulate you

4
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:46,100
 on Mr. Liang's promotion.

5
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:49,100
 Can you even call that a promotion? He only supervises the rations.

6
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:51,400
 You can't even get rice from India now.

7
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:53,700
 Those in charge of rice are more powerful than those who guard the treasury.

8
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:55,600
 Mrs. Yee is right.

9
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,100
 Me? I'm not a living Buddha.

10
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:00,300
 But you should listen to me.

11
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:02,900
 If he takes a consignment, he won't be home for 3 days.

12
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:04,400
 You'll be free then.

13
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,800
 I don't have the time.

14
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:08,100
 His relatives are always coming around.

15
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:09,300
 They pack the place, even the corridors.

16
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:10,400
I'll take that.

17
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:13,400
 I still have to settle their meals.

18
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:16,100
 It's not even as though I'm getting paid for this.

19
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:17,600
 Yeah.

20
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,400
 Don't mislead Mrs. Mak

21
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,900
 into thinking government officials

22
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:23,700
 are the tiles we're playing with now.

23
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:25,200
 Isn't that so?

24
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,600
 The Japanese would never have thought that,

25
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:31,600
 even the emperor gets henpecked.

26
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:35,100
 Eat while it's hot.

27
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:38,600
 I can't eat any more, I'm getting fat...

28
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,300
 Everyone hoards up stuff now.

29
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:43,100
 Since we can't do anything else, just hoard up fat then.

30
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:45,200
 What else is good to stock up on, Mrs. Yee?

31
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,500
 You know my husband is in the import business.

32
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:48,400
I'll take that!

33
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,700
 Even though Hong Kong has fallen,

34
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:52,300
 the ships still need to call.

35
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:55,400
I'll eat that.

36
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,800
 Western medicine.

37
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,000
 The last shipment sold out very quickly.

38
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
 He should get more of them.

39
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,700
 I heard you went to Shu Yu yesterday?

40
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:09,800
 Yes, with some others. Mrs. Mak hasn't been there before.

41
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:12,500
 It's embarrassing that I haven't.

42
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:14,500
 There're two new branches in Hong Kong.

43
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,100
 The Sichuan and Hong Kong chefs couldn't get along,

44
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:19,500
 and besides Hong Kongers can't take spicy food.

45
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:23,500
 Isn't it spicy?

46
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:26,600
 Yes, it really was.

47
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:30,600
9 Wan

48
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,700
 2 Wan.

49
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:37,700
 I'll take that.

50
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:41,100
 Mrs. Mak didn't go yesterday?

51
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:42,900
 She hasn't come for a few days.

52
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:43,900
 I had things to take care at home.

53
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:45,700
 Since you had enough players, I decided to take a break.

54
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:49,200
 An excuse to hide eh?

55
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:52,300
 Who was it who said she wasn't free a few days ago over the phone?

56
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:54,300
 That day doesn't count, I went to fetch Mrs. Mak.

57
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:55,500
 You can ask her if you don't believe me.

58
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:58,500
 I specially chose to treat you to a meal that day, Mrs. Mak.

59
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,600
 She did it deliberately.

60
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:04,600
 I'll take that tile.

61
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:10,900
 Do you still have more of those stockings?

62
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:13,700
 Yes, but I gave them all away.

63
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:15,700
 If you want I can bring more the next time.

64
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:17,100
 Ok.

65
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:19,100
 Goods are running scarce in Shanghai.

66
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:21,400
 There's even a black market for soap and toothpaste.

67
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:22,900
 You should come more often.

68
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:26,900
 There's a place for you to stay.

69
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:41,900
 I think he's had enough.

70
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:44,400
 The Kempeitai (Japanese Military Police) will demand for him.

71
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,300
 They didn't specify whether he should be dead or alive.

72
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:48,900
 Just give it to him.

73
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:50,900
 How will you account to Miura?

74
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:54,600
 They're investigating the arms the Americans supplied to Chongqing.

75
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,300
 I'll meet him tonight.

76
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:59,200
 His secretary called to say today's dinner was cancelled.

77
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:03,200
 He wants you to report directly to headquarters tomorrow.

78
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,500
 You're not returning to the office today?

79
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:21,500
 I still have an appointment.

80
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,900
 My relatives asked someone to get some from the Russians.

81
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:23,300
 Rings, jewels from the aristocracy.

82
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:25,700
 They're begging for cigarette butts on the streets.

83
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:27,200
 Afraid of getting fakes.

84
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:30,200
 You women started early today.

85
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,600
 That's a good hand you have.

86
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:36,600
 Mr. Yee is here to show his support.

87
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:41,200
 Sorry...my turn?

88
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,800
 That's a good one you have.

89
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:46,300
 How many carats is yours, three carats?

90
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:48,800
 What do you think of this? I tire of it.

91
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:52,200
 It's no longer fashionable, I was thinking of getting it changed.

92
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,500
 Pin Fen has new stock.

93
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,600
 There's a new five carat one.

94
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:58,100
 It's large, but not as bright as yours.

95
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:01,400
 Why didn't you call me then?

96
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:04,900
 I only took a brief glance.

97
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:08,500
 Pin Fen has some stuff that can't be gotten outside.

98
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:11,500
They wouldn't sell that fire gem to me.

99
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:14,000
 How much is it worth now?

100
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,300
 That fire gem of yours is ten carats.

101
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:18,000
 It's not as though it's a pigeon's egg.

102
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,500
 Gems are just stones.

103
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:23,500
 If you wear such large jewellery, you can't even play mahjong.

104
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,900
 Nagging at me even though you wouldn't buy it for me.

105
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:29,100
 Ah, I won!

106
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:30,000
Combo win.

107
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,700
 I was about to win myself. It's all Mr. Yee's fault,

108
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:34,400
 for saying you can't play mahjong if you wear jewellery.

109
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,300
 He did it on purpose.

110
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:36,300
 Thank you Mr. Yee.

111
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:38,200
 Mr. Yee should treat us to a meal.

112
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:41,800
 Sure, where do you want to go?

113
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,500
 Shu Yu. Western medicine?

114
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:47,500
 Not Shu Yu, let's choose somewhere more expensive.

115
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,800
 Oh dear, I forget.

116
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,900
 I have an appointment at three.

117
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:57,600
 And I forgot all about it.

118
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:00,200
 That won't do, who'll play then?

119
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:03,000
 You should have said so earlier!

120
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,800
 I need to discuss something with someone.

121
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,300
 And I forgot all about it...

122
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:09,500
 Why don't you sit in for me, Mr. Yee?

123
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:10,900
 I'll be right back.

124
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:14,100
 And my luck had just turned for the better.

125
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:15,500
 Not today, I have something on.

126
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,100
 I'll play overnight with you ladies some other day.

127
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:19,600
 Mrs. Mak is too inconsiderate.

128
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:22,400
 My husband has some money owed to him, it's been a few years already,

129
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:25,400
 the debtor finally agreed to to pay up a portion.

130
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,600
 Let's ask Mrs. Liao then.

131
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:31,100
 Shen-ma, could you call Mrs. Liao over?

132
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:35,100
 You owe us a treat.

133
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:05,800
 Mrs. Mak, Mrs.Yee says you can use the car.

134
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,700
 The car is waiting for you.

135
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:10,000
 I really couldn't.

136
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,700
 Isn't't Mrs. Mak going...?

137
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:15,700
 Ok, thank you.

138
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:19,700
 I'll be right down.

139
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:43,900
 There are less cars in Shanghai than in Hong Kong.

140
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:47,900
 Gas is expensive. Even those who have cars don't drive any more.

141
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:53,500
 Mrs. Mak, your Shanghainese is very good.

142
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,400
 My Mum is from Shanghai.

143
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,900
 When I was young some relatives of mine

144
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:59,500
 moved over to Hong Kong when the war started.

145
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:03,500
 Really?

146
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,900
 These foreigners, they can only redeem this much a day.

147
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:34,900
 They can only get hard bread to eat.

148
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:51,500
 Do you need me to fetch you later?

149
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:55,500
 No, I can call a cab.

150
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,400
 Coffee, please.

151
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:48,400
 Sure.

152
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:13,700
 May I use your phone?

153
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:17,700
 Of course.

154
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:37,900
 Strange, did I call the wrong number?

155
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,700
 Hello.

156
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:53,400
 Second brother, it's me.

157
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:57,400
 Yes?

158
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,300
 I'm at the Keseling cafe now.

159
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:02,600
 Is everything alright at home?

160
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,600
 Yes.

161
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:07,000
 I'm good, just too busy recently

162
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:11,000
 to call back home.

163
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:12,800
 I'm going to go shopping today.

164
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:15,400
 I have a date, I'm going now.

165
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:19,400
 Ok.

166
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:25,100
 Well, then, there's nothing else.

167
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:27,700
 I know, it'll be ok.

168
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:31,700
 I'm going, goodbye.

169
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:39,200
 We're moving out now.

170
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:04,900
 If you guys win we'll marry you!

171
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,400
 I didn't say I'd be the one marrying them.

172
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:09,500
 The men have all gone to war.

173
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:11,500
 Who's going to marry this truckload of girls?

174
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:15,500
 I'm not going to, you marry him then!

175
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,700
 I heard from teacher that Guangzhou has been lost.

176
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:33,600
 Will it be safe in Hong Kong?

177
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:37,300
 I never thought that we'd have to rely on the Brits to protect us.

178
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:39,400
 Isn't your Dad in Britain?

179
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:42,400
 Why didn't he bring you with him?

180
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,500
 He took my younger brother.

181
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:47,700
 When my Mum died he said he'd take me.

182
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:51,600
 But two years later, war broke out.

183
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,300
 I'm not going back again.

184
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:55,800
 War gave me the chance to go to Hong Kong.

185
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:59,800
 I want to go overseas and see the world outside.

186
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,300
 See you by the pond after class tonight.

187
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:19,400
 Let's go back to our apartment together.

188
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,900
 Ok.

189
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:24,900
 Hey, Lai Shu Jin!

190
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:28,800
 I was just looking for you.

191
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,500
 Kuang Yumin, you still remember me?

192
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,200
 Yes, I saw you acting.

193
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,400
 Lingnan University's Women's Drama Society.

194
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:36,800
 We've set up a new drama society.

195
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:40,100
 We're auditioning for members today.

196
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:41,400
 But the women's drama society has never

197
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,300
 collaborated with males.

198
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:45,600
 Since we're borrowing Hong Kong University's premises for classes

199
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:49,600
 and we have a lack of manpower, we should work together.

200
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,800
 We can do Ibsen's A Doll House!

201
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,800
 I know Nora's lines at the back of my hand.

202
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,700
 At this kind of time who has the mood

203
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:58,300
 to see this kind of bourgeoise show?

204
00:16:58,300 --> 00:16:59,800
 We're intending to stage a patriotic play

205
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:02,400
 to raise funds for the war.

206
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:06,400
 You should come for the audition tomorrow too.

207
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:09,400
 But I'm only a freshman, I've never acted before.

208
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,600
 It doesn't matter.

209
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:13,000
 Everyone should play their part for the resistance movement.

210
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,600
 While the soldiers are fighting on the frontlines,

211
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:18,300
 the Hong Kongers are relaxing.

212
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:22,300
 We need to awaken them from their complacency.

213
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,600
 What a typical director, he doesn't listen to anyone.

214
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:29,800
 But since it's the resistance,

215
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:33,000
 we girls can't lose out to the guys.

216
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,400
 I just can't stand the thought of following his beck and call.

217
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:40,100
 He's quite passionate isn't he?

218
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:41,800
 Not long after his brother graduated from the military academy,

219
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:43,300
 he got killed in the war.

220
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:45,500
 So his family wouldn't let him join the army.

221
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:49,500
 So that's why he's so agitated.

222
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:54,200
 I don't want him to get drafted either.

223
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:57,500
 I return myself to the land which nurtured me.

224
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:58,300
 And my soul...

225
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:02,300
 More to the left, more.

226
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:06,200
 Ok, that's fine.

227
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:10,200
 Let's try it out.

228
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:43,700
 What's up?

229
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:45,500
 My Dad got married.

230
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:49,500
 I'm writing a letter to congratulate him.

231
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:49,000
 The pre-stage jitters will disappear once the curtains open.

232
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:39,500
 Auntie Zhao!

233
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:42,000
 They found this officer behind the hills.

234
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
 Xiao Hong, has your brother come home?

235
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,200
 Shh! Come in quickly.

236
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:50,400
 My son! Quickly, go boil some water.

237
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:53,500
 What happened to you?

238
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:57,500
 He's an army officer, not your son.

239
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:02,700
 My son is coming home tonight.

240
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:03,900
 Coming home to eat dinner.

241
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:06,500
 I should slaughter a chicken for him.

242
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,900
 My son is coming back!

243
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:11,500
 He's coming back today!

244
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:15,500
 My son is coming back.

245
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,100
 My son is coming back.

246
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:23,000
 Ever since she knew my brother died on the warfront,

247
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,700
 my Mum took ill.

248
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:28,700
 I made this for my brother.

249
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:32,700
 I just finished knitting it, but he'll never get to wear it.

250
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:37,700
 Please have it!

251
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:40,000
 I can't, you saved my life.

252
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,500
 I don't have anything to repay you with.

253
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:43,100
 Saving our country is payment enough!

254
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:46,700
 Killing the enemy is taking revenge for my brother!

255
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:49,400
 I hate myself for being a woman,

256
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:53,400
 and I promised my brother

257
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:57,100
 to take care of Mum.

258
00:21:57,100 --> 00:22:00,500
 I want to set his mind at rest...

259
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:04,500
 Your brother...

260
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:10,300
 He was the same age as you. Ever since my Dad died,

261
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:15,100
 he'd been taking care of the family.

262
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:17,300
 He'd work faster than everyone else.

263
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:18,500
 Every year during the harvest,

264
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:22,500
 he'd help others after harvesting our own crops.

265
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:27,400
 He was also as rugged as you.

266
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:32,200
 I'd always follow him wherever he went.

267
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:36,900
 He'd always say Heaven would bless the honest and kind.

268
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:44,900
 Our family had our hopes pinned on him.

269
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,200
 I'll kowtow to you!

270
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:54,100
 For this country, for my dead brother,

271
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:56,700
 for the generations of people,

272
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:59,900
 China cannot fall!!

273
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:03,900
 China cannot fall!

274
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:09,400
 China cannot fall!

275
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:14,000
 China cannot fall!

276
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:18,200
 China cannot fall!

277
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:24,600
 Cheers!

278
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:28,500
 This calls for a celebration!

279
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:31,200
 That was really great, everyone was shouting out:

280
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:35,200
 China cannot fall!

281
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:39,000
 China cannot fall!

282
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,700
 600! 600 people seated in the audience.

283
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:42,800
 And those standing in the aisle too!

284
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:44,600
 Don't underestimate these Hong Kongers eh?

285
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:46,600
 When we performed at Lingnan,

286
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:48,800
 we never had such an enthusiastic response.

287
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:52,000
 What we staged is the reality.

288
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,200
 The audience can emphasise, so naturally they're touched.

289
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:59,200
 During the fund-raising I saw many people tearing.

290
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:03,300
 Cheers to everyone, for raising this sum of money,

291
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:07,300
 and doing our bit for the war.

292
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:10,100
 We must drink to our heart's content tonight.

293
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:12,700
 Let's worry about the nation tomorrow.

294
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:16,700
 Cheers, bro!

295
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:18,900
 I have an idea, listen to me.

296
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:21,300
 We should sell tickets.

297
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:24,600
 And write on the door: While stocks last!

298
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:25,300
 If it's you, it's more like:

299
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:27,900
 It's hard to sell even one ticket

300
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:29,900
 Here, give me the drinks.

301
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:31,200
 Careful!

302
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,500
 Cheers to our leading man and lady!

303
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:34,600
 Our ticket sales depend on her!

304
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:38,600
 To our leading man and lady!

305
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:42,800
 I'm not, I'm not.

306
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,600
We're the peach blossoms of today,

307
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:48,500
 The pillars of society tomorrow,

308
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:51,500
 We're singing together today,

309
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:55,500
 Saving the people tomorrow on a giant wave,

310
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:01,800
 A giant wave, continuously expanding,

311
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:04,200
 Classmates, my dear students,

312
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:08,200
 let your strength prop up the rise and fall of this world,

313
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:12,600
 A giant wave, a giant wave,

314
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:17,500
 Hurry!

315
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:21,500
 To the top!

316
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:30,400
 Have you lighted it?

317
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,700
 It won't do if peformers don't smoke.

318
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:48,700
 Try it, it'll come in useful during acting.

319
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:55,600
 Wong Chia Chi took a blow, who wants...

320
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:59,600
 Gimme!

321
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:10,100
 Let me take a drag!

322
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:53,100
 Thank you.

323
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:57,100
 Why?

324
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:43,800
 Wong Chia Chi.

325
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:47,800
 Come up!

326
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:52,300
 I met a fellow villager from my hometown

327
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:53,300
 called Tsao De Xi.

328
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:56,800
 He went to the same school as my brother, so we're familiar with each other.

329
00:27:56,800 --> 00:28:00,100
 I heard he's an Assistant Officer, working for the guy

330
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:01,100
 in charge of the Peace Exercise.

331
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:02,600
 His name is Yee.

332
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:05,200
 He's Wang Jingwei's aide, in charge of espionage and spying.

333
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,800
 He's now in Hong Kong.

334
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:08,900
 Wang Jingwei's runs the Peaceful Exercise, but

335
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:11,800
 he's just a lackey of the Japanese.

336
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:13,400
 He's a traitor who betrayed our country.

337
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:15,100
 Wang is now accumulating troops.

338
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:17,900
 Hong Kong is under Yee's purview.

339
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:21,900
 This Tsao guy I met...

340
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:27,800
 This is a chance.

341
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:30,500
 What chance?

342
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:33,300
 This isn't theatre.

343
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:36,300
 No matter how much we trade on our audience's tears and shout our voices hoarse,

344
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:40,100
 it's incomparable to killing a real traitor.

345
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:43,200
 We can do it this holidays so the school won't find out.

346
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,300
 We need to disguise ourselves

347
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:47,400
 and think of a way to infiltrate the Yee household.

348
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:48,800
 I'll get a favour from Old Tsao

349
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:51,400
 and get him to introduce us.

350
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:52,100
 And then we'll get guns,

351
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:55,400
 But which of us knows how to kill a person?

352
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:57,000
 We've only killed people on stage.

353
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,000
 When you see a traitor in front of your eyes,

354
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,100
 you'll know that killing isn't difficult at all.

355
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:04,800
 It's only a matter of how many, how fast.

356
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:08,400
 This is a matter of life and death, I want everyone to consider it carefully.

357
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:11,700
 If you're in, then let's make this a big one.

358
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:15,400
 Knives together, let's not waste our youth,

359
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:18,600
 and slay one of Wang Jingwei's lackeys!

360
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:20,100
 I'm in!

361
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:24,100
 Count me in.

362
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:31,600
 Then we'll too...

363
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:36,000
 I don't want to force anyone.

364
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:40,200
 I'm in too.

365
00:29:57,400 --> 00:30:01,400
 'lil un, I didn't expect you'd come find me.

366
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:06,700
 We haven't met since we left our hometown.

367
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:10,400
 Less talk. Cheers!

368
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:14,400
 Drink up.

369
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:18,300
 I should also thank Brother Tsao.

370
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:20,500
 From now on you must take care of us.

371
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:21,500
 Sure, sure sure.

372
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:23,600
 Here's one to you!

373
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:27,600
 Brother, can you see if you can help us?

374
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:32,700
 Can you help us find work?

375
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:36,700
 It's tough, but let me think of something.

376
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:52,400
 Where's Liang Junsheng? He's still up there.

377
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:54,000
 What's he doing?

378
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,900
 We only have enough for Tsao.

379
00:30:56,900 --> 00:31:00,100
 Maybe he can get more information.

380
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:04,100
 Just on those few glasses of cat's piss?

381
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:24,300
 The caucasians have all gone on holiday.

382
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:28,300
 We can use the second floor for two months.

383
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:42,300
 Where'd you get the money from?

384
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:44,100
 My Dad left me some money in Hong Kong

385
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:46,100
 in case of emergencies.

386
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:47,900
 I didn't ask you to get something so luxurious.

387
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:50,300
 If you want Auyang to be Mr. Mak, a businessman

388
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:52,600
 and Wong Chia Chi to be Mrs. Mak, a rich housewife,

389
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:54,700
 this is the kind of place they should live in!

390
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:57,200
 Let's decorate this place and get some furniture.

391
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:58,900
 And get a maid.

392
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:02,900
 Does Mr. Mak need a moustache?

393
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:16,700
 Hold on.

394
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:34,400
 Don't use my best tie to wipe your mouth with!

395
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:37,400
 This isn't a rehearsal, there won't be a second chance.

396
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:39,200
 Remember your own roles.

397
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:43,200
 Don't say what you're not supposed to say.

398
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:47,900
 You too...

399
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:53,100
 They're here!

400
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:13,800
 Mr. Mak, Mrs. Mak.

401
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:17,800
 This is Mr. Mak's cousin, a friend from my hometown, Kuang Yumin.

402
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:22,400
 This is Mr. Yee, and Mrs. Yee.

403
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:37,700
 You accompany them, I'll take my leave first.

404
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:44,800
 Sorry about making you drive all the way here to get me.

405
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:46,600
 Old Tsao said you were familiar with Hong Kong.

406
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:49,000
 If not we'd have used my husband's car.

407
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,300
 It's no problem, it's along the way.

408
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:54,100
 Mrs. Yee, do you want to visit Chung Wan?

409
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:55,400
 Though we've been in Hong Kong for a few months already,

410
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:59,400
 the only places we know are Chung Wan and Repulse Bay.

411
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:03,100
 How about Tsim Sha Tsui then?

412
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:04,700
 We can take a stroll there too.

413
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:07,000
 Sure.

414
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:11,000
 To Tsim Sha Tsui, Queen's Harbour.

415
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:23,800
 Can you drop us off before you return to the office?

416
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:26,400
 It won't matter if we make a slight detour right?

417
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:28,800
 I wouldn't want to inconvenience Mr. Mak's official business.

418
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:32,200
 It's a family business, it's all right.

419
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:36,200
 What line are you in, Mr. Mak?

420
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:40,300
 Export trading.

421
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:44,000
 We also do importing.

422
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,900
 Mrs. Yee, where you live is pretty good.

423
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:50,000
 When we were looking for a house, did we look here?

424
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,300
 It's just a rental. Once war broke out on the mainland,

425
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:56,300
 we moved here hastily.

426
00:34:58,100 --> 00:35:02,100
 Mrs. Mak, were you born here?

427
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:06,300
 I married here, my Mum's hometown is in Guangzhou.

428
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:08,300
 My Mum is from Shanghai.

429
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:11,000
 Then your Shanghainese must be good.

430
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,100
 I can speak, but not well.

431
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:14,900
 I've forgotten it all.

432
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:17,600
 My hometown is Anhui.

433
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:21,600
 My Shanghainese isn't too good either.

434
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:41,800
 Thanks, sorry for bothering you,

435
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:43,700
 and helping me carry my stuff.

436
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:45,400
 No, I should.

437
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:47,000
 You're welcome, since he's my husband's cousin.

438
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,500
 He also just arrived in Hong Kong.

439
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:52,500
 We brought him along to see the sights.

440
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:59,400
 What do you do in Guangzhou?

441
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:03,100
 I teach, in an elementary school in the village.

442
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:06,000
 As expected, you have a scholarly air.

443
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,800
 Either a college student or a teacher.

444
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:12,800
 Mrs. Yee, you have a good eye.

445
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:15,500
 Didn't you see those plainclothes bodyguards?

446
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:17,800
 There's no way we can make a move on him at his own place.

447
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:20,600
 Whenever he goes out there're at least a few bodyguards by his side in addition to the chaffeur.

448
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:22,800
 Even if we get him out there're at least three people we'll have to deal with.

449
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:24,700
 We need at least two guns.

450
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:26,900
 But it's still better than attacking him at home.

451
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:30,900
 Be more patient, we're already on track.

452
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:33,500
 Mrs. Yee has a good impression of Wong Chia Chi.

453
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:37,100
 She's already arranged a second meeting.

454
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:41,100
 Sorry, I'm tired.

455
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:58,500
 Can I come in?

456
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:02,500
 Come in.

457
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:13,200
 I pressed the tailor to hurry.

458
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:17,200
 Thank you.

459
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:51,000
 What does Yee look like?

460
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:55,100
 I only got a glimpse, he wasn't what I expected.

461
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,500
 Our cook, he just left like that.

462
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:14,500
 He didn't take anything, but the man just disappeared.

463
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,700
 So we moved to the Ban Dao hotel.

464
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:19,900
 It's already five days, and we don't dare to go back...

465
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:23,900
 My husband says it isn't safe, so we need to find somewhere else to stay.

466
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:25,700
 You can't trust the people here.

467
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:28,800
 These Cantonese, I can't catch a word of what they're saying.

468
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:31,200
 Exactly, I'm quite irritated.

469
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:33,200
 Where can I find a cook,

470
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:36,200
 who can whip up some decent Shanghainese dishes now?

471
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:37,800
 I know there's a place in Hong Kong,

472
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:39,700
 which serves decent Shanghainese food.

473
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:42,700
 They have good fried shallot carp and drunken chicken.

474
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:44,900
 Then bring us there!

475
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:46,800
 Hey, Old Yee, Mrs. Mak just said

476
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:49,800
 there's a good Shanghainese restaurant in Hong Kong.

477
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:51,100
 Old Yee is a fussy eater.

478
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:53,200
 He compalains no matter how good the resturant is.

479
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:55,800
 Really? Which one?

480
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:58,500
 It's the Zhu's, at Kowloon.

481
00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:01,800
 It's the main branch of the Shanghai Restaurant in Hong Kong.

482
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:05,200
 I think I've heard of it.

483
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:07,300
 I'll be back late tonight.

484
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:10,700
 Don't remember we have guests tomorrow.

485
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:14,700
 Good night.

486
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:18,100
 We're not invited tomorrow?

487
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:20,600
 He didn't tell me who the guest is.

488
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:24,200
 It must be Wang Jingwei's wife, Chen Bijun.

489
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:27,100
 They're forming a new government.

490
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:28,700
 They sent for Old Hsiao already.

491
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:32,700
 That means Mr. Yee is going to be promoted isn't he?

492
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:43,500
As she said...

493
00:39:57,500 --> 00:39:58,500
 Why're you so late?

494
00:39:58,500 --> 00:39:59,800
 Was playing mahjong.

495
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:01,600
 Sorry, I lost again.

496
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:04,200
 What about Mr. Yee?

497
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:05,700
 Barely saw him for a minute.

498
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:08,400
 He left and didn't come back.

499
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:12,400
 Hey, move aside, I'm bushed.

500
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:34,600
 Hey, I killed a beer bottle.

501
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:37,300
 It's already been a month.

502
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:39,300
 What's so great about shooting one or two beer bottles?

503
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:40,600
 You might as well shoot me!

504
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:43,000
 To spare my Dad from doing the job.

505
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,400
 The house, car, losing at mahjong.

506
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:47,000
 Shopping for expensive stuff, buying a whore for you,

507
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
 Are we here on holiday or to kill a traitor?

508
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,200
 How many Dads do you think I have?

509
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:52,000
 Wong Chia Chi needs expensive jewellery,

510
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,000
 and you want to be a Resistance hero,

511
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:56,100
 What about me? I'm a chauffeur in the day and a sentry at night.

512
00:40:56,100 --> 00:40:57,500
 My Dad has been asking around.

513
00:40:57,500 --> 00:41:00,100
 He thinks I've been fooling around in Hongkong.

514
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:02,000
 He wants to break off all ties with me.

515
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:05,000
 Why don't you guys think about that!

516
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,200
 We have guns.

517
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:08,200
 Why don't we kill some easy ones first?

518
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:11,100
 If not school will be starting soon.

519
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:12,800
 Everyone's here voluntarily.

520
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:15,300
 We can't blame it all on Kuang Yumin.

521
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:16,600
 I know we're in financial difficulties.

522
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:18,500
 I should have planned for this.

523
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:20,100
 I admit we don't have any experience.

524
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:21,600
 But we committed ourselves to this.

525
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:23,400
 We finally inflitrated the Yee household after so much effort.

526
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:25,800
 We can't just give up now.

527
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:27,300
 The guards are now familiar with me.

528
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:28,800
 I'll find a chance to do it myself.

529
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:30,700
 Don't worry, I'll take care of the consequences.

530
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:32,700
 Don't be dumb, you think you can do it alone?

531
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:36,700
 That's my problem.

532
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:49,300
 My documents are in the study.

533
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:53,300
 Mr. Yee.

534
00:41:53,300 --> 00:41:55,700
 Mrs. Mak.

535
00:41:55,700 --> 00:41:59,700
 The car broke down halfway. And it started raining.

536
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:06,800
 Send Mrs. Mak in.

537
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:19,400
 Hongkong's so humid. You can wring out water even in a handshake.

538
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:21,700
 Yeah, even Shanghai isn't that bad.

539
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:25,400
 I'm still not used to it even now.

540
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:26,900
 Mrs. Hsiao.

541
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:30,900
 I thought you wouldn't be coming because of the weather.

542
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:32,800
 Why are you back?

543
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:35,700
 Rain's too heavy, I changed my plans.

544
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:37,900
 Mrs. Mak, Mrs. Zhu, you're here?

545
00:42:37,900 --> 00:42:39,100
 We're waiting for Mrs. Hsiao.

546
00:42:39,100 --> 00:42:42,300
 Just nice, we need one more player.

547
00:42:42,300 --> 00:42:43,800
 I still have something to do.

548
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:45,800
 Why don't you just play for a while?

549
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:47,600
 You haven't played for ages.

550
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:51,600
 Mr. Yee, Mrs. Yee's getting angry.

551
00:42:54,100 --> 00:42:58,100
 Ok.

552
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:12,000
 Mr. Yee liked the material we chose that day.

553
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,200
 He didn't like the last one.

554
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:15,600
 Is there any tailor you're familiar with?

555
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:18,400
 Yes, I know of one, he's quite good.

556
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:22,400
 We make our suits and dresses there.

557
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:27,300
 Want to try making one there?

558
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:31,300
 I'll leave it to you.

559
00:43:37,100 --> 00:43:38,200
 But it's the peak season now.

560
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:40,900
 They're busy with tourists' requests.

561
00:43:40,900 --> 00:43:42,700
 Will it take a few months?

562
00:43:42,700 --> 00:43:44,600
 No, not that long. We're old customers anyway.

563
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:48,600
 I can hurry him.

564
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:59,400
 When Mr. Yee is free,

565
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:03,000
 Mrs. Yee can give me a call.

566
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:07,000
 Mrs. Mak, I have your phone number.

567
00:44:17,500 --> 00:44:18,900
 We can probably get a discount

568
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:21,900
 if we make one or two more.

569
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:23,500
 Mr. Yee prefers UK imports

570
00:44:23,500 --> 00:44:25,700
 they don't give discounts for those.

571
00:44:25,700 --> 00:44:29,700
 Really?

572
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:41,000
 I've won!

573
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:53,000
 Your luck today is pretty good.

574
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:56,000
 I didn't even realise I'd won.

575
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:00,000
 The God of Fortune must have come.

576
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:34,100
 Ah, Mr. Yee.

577
00:45:34,100 --> 00:45:38,100
 I recognised your voice.

578
00:45:45,500 --> 00:45:49,000
 It'll complement your face more if the collar is narrower.

579
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:53,000
 Yes, a smaller collar looks better.

580
00:45:54,300 --> 00:45:58,300
 Shorten the sleeves a little more.

581
00:45:58,700 --> 00:46:00,800
 I said, you should shorten the sleeves.

582
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:02,100
 It'll make you look more sprightly.

583
00:46:02,100 --> 00:46:06,100
 I'll leave it to you.

584
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:09,400
 This is a more modern design.

585
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:13,400
 The collar looks good.

586
00:46:13,700 --> 00:46:17,500
 Your dress is ready.

587
00:46:17,500 --> 00:46:21,500
 I'll try it on.

588
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:33,800
 Go and eat first, don't wait for me.

589
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:47,200
 Does Mrs. Mak often make her clothes here?

590
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:48,900
 Yes.

591
00:46:48,900 --> 00:46:52,900
 She's a frequent customer of ours.

592
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:12,400
 It's too fitting, I can't breathe properly.

593
00:47:13,700 --> 00:47:16,200
 Mrs. Yee originally chose this one.

594
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:20,200
 But she didn't want it so I took it.

595
00:47:23,900 --> 00:47:26,800
 I'll leave it as it is then. I'll take it off.

596
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:30,800
 Wear it.

597
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:50,200
 Alright.

598
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:56,300
 Is Mrs. Yee ok?

599
00:47:56,300 --> 00:48:00,300
 Old Cao will bring her to the doctor.

600
00:48:00,300 --> 00:48:04,300
 She said she had a headache when we were about to leave. Must be the mahjong.

601
00:48:05,100 --> 00:48:08,700
 My husband doesn't like me to play mahjong too.

602
00:48:08,700 --> 00:48:11,500
 I said, men have many ways to entertain themselves outside.

603
00:48:11,500 --> 00:48:15,400
 But for women, we can only shop and play mahjong.

604
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:19,400
 Mahjong isn't that bad, at least we stay at home.

605
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:20,900
 When I called today

606
00:48:20,900 --> 00:48:24,900
 did I disturb you?

607
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:27,500
 My husband isn't home, he went to Singapore.

608
00:48:27,500 --> 00:48:29,800
 So his friends came over to accompany me

609
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:32,400
 in case I was bored.

610
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:36,000
 But in fact he's getting them to keep watch on me.

611
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:40,000
 I had an excuse to escape because you called.

612
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:44,800
 Really?

613
00:49:00,700 --> 00:49:04,700
 I don't mind going out alone when I'm free.

614
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:08,900
 My husband isn't interested in the things I like.

615
00:49:08,900 --> 00:49:10,800
 What do you like?

616
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:14,800
 Watching movies. He doesn't want to go so I go alone.

617
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:17,300
 He's always talking business with those friends of his.

618
00:49:17,300 --> 00:49:20,000
 They're not interested in the movies at all.

619
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:23,100
 I don't watch movies too.

620
00:49:23,100 --> 00:49:27,100
 Mr. Yee is a busy man. Only frivolous people watch movies.

621
00:49:27,100 --> 00:49:31,100
 No, that's not it. I'm afraid of the dark.

622
00:49:36,600 --> 00:49:40,600
 Will you drink some?

623
00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:43,600
 I'll drink a little with you.

624
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:47,600
 We don't know many people in Hongkong, so we're always troubling you.

625
00:49:47,700 --> 00:49:51,500
 It's trivial stuff, you don't have to stand on airs.

626
00:49:51,500 --> 00:49:55,500
 If you're observant, nothing is trivial.

627
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:10,900
 There don't seem to be many customers here.

628
00:50:10,900 --> 00:50:14,900
 It's because their food sucks.

629
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:19,400
 Sorry. But it's convenient to talk here.

630
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:23,400
 No one will disturb you.

631
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:29,400
 Is Mr. Mak busy with his work?

632
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:32,400
 I don't even know what he's busy about.

633
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:35,000
 He went to Singapore in the past two days.

634
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:39,000
 But as long as the men don't come home, everything else's fine.

635
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:43,400
 Isn't it?

636
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:48,200
 What kind of business does Mr. Mak do?

637
00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:50,000
 Import and export.

638
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,100
 If you're so interested in Mr. Mak,

639
00:50:52,100 --> 00:50:55,000
 I'll bring him along the next time.

640
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,600
 At least men have more conversation topics among themselves.

641
00:50:57,600 --> 00:51:01,600
 With women they can only talk about trivial matters.

642
00:51:02,900 --> 00:51:06,100
 To me, a chance to talk relaxedly like this

643
00:51:06,100 --> 00:51:10,100
 is hard to come by.

644
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:18,400
 The people I associate with are those with high reputations.

645
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:20,300
 They talk all the time about politics.

646
00:51:20,300 --> 00:51:22,500
 The fate of generations hang by their mouths.

647
00:51:22,500 --> 00:51:25,200
 It doesn't matter what their views are.

648
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:29,200
 In all of their eyes I see the same thing:

649
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,500
 What?

650
00:51:32,500 --> 00:51:35,800
 Fear.

651
00:51:35,800 --> 00:51:39,800
 What about you? You're different from the rest.

652
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:44,000
 You're not afraid, are you?

653
00:51:46,100 --> 00:51:50,100
 What about you?

654
00:51:51,500 --> 00:51:55,500
 You're smart, but you're not very good at mahjong.

655
00:51:58,100 --> 00:52:02,100
 Yeah, I always lose.

656
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:06,200
 I've only won you before.

657
00:52:57,300 --> 00:52:59,300
 Your suit is ready, do you want me to collect it for you?

658
00:52:59,300 --> 00:53:03,300
 I'll call you.

659
00:53:07,900 --> 00:53:10,500
 I have an appointment later.

660
00:53:10,500 --> 00:53:14,500
 I still have some time, so I'll send you home first.

661
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:20,000
 Is it convenient?

662
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:24,000
 Yes.

663
00:53:43,700 --> 00:53:44,800
 They're here!

664
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:48,800
 Turn off the lights, guard the outside.

665
00:53:50,200 --> 00:53:52,100
 Thanks. I'll send you to the door.

666
00:53:52,100 --> 00:53:54,500
 You don't have to.

667
00:53:54,500 --> 00:53:58,500
 Wait for me.

668
00:54:03,700 --> 00:54:05,500
 They're coming!

669
00:54:05,500 --> 00:54:09,500
 Turn off the lights!

670
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:19,000
 They're about to come in.

671
00:54:21,700 --> 00:54:25,700
 Don't blame me if you miss your appointment.

672
00:54:44,800 --> 00:54:48,800
 Too bad you have an appointment...or, you can send the car away.

673
00:54:50,500 --> 00:54:54,500
 Come up for some tea.

674
00:55:57,400 --> 00:56:01,400
 Give me a stiff drink.

675
00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:06,200
 He's very careful, when we were at the tailor's

676
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:08,700
 he sent away Old Hsiao and the bodyguard.

677
00:56:08,700 --> 00:56:11,600
 That means even Old Hsiao isn't someone he trusts.

678
00:56:11,600 --> 00:56:14,200
 No worries, just do the same thing the next time

679
00:56:14,200 --> 00:56:16,600
 and get him into the house, we'll get him with one bullet.

680
00:56:16,600 --> 00:56:19,000
 He's wary of Mr. Mak, so he won't come in.

681
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:20,600
 He meets at very obscure places.

682
00:56:20,600 --> 00:56:24,600
 Possibly Old Hsiao might not even know of them.

683
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,000
 Is he interested...

684
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:31,000
 Mr. Mak isn't pleased.

685
00:56:31,700 --> 00:56:35,700
 Not yet. But I know his intentions.

686
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:37,700
 Otherwise he wouldn't have sent me to the door.

687
00:56:37,700 --> 00:56:41,200
 It's just that he's too afraid to come in.

688
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:45,200
 He was dallying by the entrance.

689
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:50,100
 He said he wanted to see me again.

690
00:56:50,100 --> 00:56:51,600
 I originally thought of meeting at the cinema.

691
00:56:51,600 --> 00:56:55,000
 Since it'll be easier to make an escape there.

692
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,500
 But he's a really careful man.

693
00:56:57,500 --> 00:57:01,500
 He said he wouldn't go to dark places.

694
00:57:02,700 --> 00:57:06,400
 If he calls again it'll be serious.

695
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:10,400
 I'll have to agree to be his mistress.

696
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:15,200
 And then?

697
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:19,200
 Have you guys thought, what next?

698
00:58:00,100 --> 00:58:04,000
 Do you know how to do it?

699
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:08,000
 Between a man and a woman...?

700
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:13,200
 You've all discussed this before already?

701
00:58:24,300 --> 00:58:28,300
 Who?

702
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:35,000
 Only Liang Junsheng has experience.

703
00:58:35,100 --> 00:58:39,100
 With a whore?

704
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:36,500
 Do you want to drink?

705
00:59:36,500 --> 00:59:40,500
 No need.

706
01:00:02,300 --> 01:00:06,300
 The lights.

707
01:02:04,500 --> 01:02:07,300
 You seem to be more responsive today.

708
01:02:07,300 --> 01:02:11,300
 I don't want to discuss this with you.

709
01:02:48,600 --> 01:02:52,600
 We cooked some porridge.

710
01:03:13,800 --> 01:03:17,800
 Hello? Mrs. Mak, how are you?

711
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:21,600
 I called you two days ago.

712
01:03:21,600 --> 01:03:24,800
 But you weren't in.

713
01:03:24,800 --> 01:03:28,800
 I wanted to ask if you've tailored the clothes?

714
01:03:29,800 --> 01:03:33,800
 You're not having it done any more? Why?

715
01:03:42,900 --> 01:03:46,900
 Going back to Shanghai?

716
01:03:49,400 --> 01:03:53,400
 Well, congratulations then.

717
01:03:54,500 --> 01:03:58,500
 I'll go over right now.

718
01:03:58,900 --> 01:04:01,300
 You haven't called for the past few days.

719
01:04:01,300 --> 01:04:05,300
 So I thought I'd drop by.

720
01:04:16,100 --> 01:04:18,500
 I'll go to the airport tomorrow then.

721
01:04:18,500 --> 01:04:20,000
 I should really...

722
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,700
 I should really see you off, right?

723
01:04:22,700 --> 01:04:26,700
 You're leaving just like that?

724
01:04:33,100 --> 01:04:37,100
 I see.

725
01:04:37,400 --> 01:04:41,400
 Give Mr. Yee my regards.

726
01:04:41,600 --> 01:04:45,600
 Bon voyage.

727
01:04:45,600 --> 01:04:49,600
 Goodbye.

728
01:05:54,700 --> 01:05:57,900
 Moving house? Hope I'm not disturbing.

729
01:05:57,900 --> 01:06:01,900
 Huang, you're no longer driving? A mover now are you?

730
01:06:04,700 --> 01:06:06,900
 What are you doing here, Cao?

731
01:06:06,900 --> 01:06:08,900
 To pay Mr. and Mrs. Mak a visit.

732
01:06:08,900 --> 01:06:12,900
 And their cute friends.

733
01:06:15,300 --> 01:06:19,300
 What do you want?

734
01:06:19,900 --> 01:06:23,000
 Right from the start I knew something was wrong.

735
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:24,200
 I kept quiet about it

736
01:06:24,200 --> 01:06:27,000
 so I could see what you were up to.

737
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:30,900
 So Mr. Mak is from Lingnan University.

738
01:06:30,900 --> 01:06:34,900
 Cao, don't do anything reckless.

739
01:06:43,500 --> 01:06:47,400
 Mr. Yee didn't take me to Shanghai.

740
01:06:47,400 --> 01:06:49,600
 Why don't I repent my ways?

741
01:06:49,600 --> 01:06:52,100
 I know a lot more than you guys.

742
01:06:52,100 --> 01:06:53,200
 Your superiors must know

743
01:06:53,200 --> 01:06:57,200
 that I'm more valuable than you guys.

744
01:06:58,100 --> 01:07:00,500
 How much money do you want?

745
01:07:00,500 --> 01:07:04,400
 I'd say at least 10 gold taels.

746
01:07:04,400 --> 01:07:08,400
 And that doesn't include Mrs. Mak's price.

747
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:13,000
 I'm thinking Mr. Yee would pay even more for her.

748
01:07:14,100 --> 01:07:17,000
 You're asking for it!

749
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:18,200
 You really have it going, bro.

750
01:07:18,200 --> 01:07:20,300
 I didn't know you were a spy.

751
01:07:20,300 --> 01:07:23,200
 You should be the one helping me out.

752
01:07:23,200 --> 01:07:24,400
 Instead why are you making use of me?

753
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:28,400
 Even though we're fellow villagers.

754
01:08:20,900 --> 01:08:21,700
 You helped a traitor!

755
01:08:21,700 --> 01:08:25,700
 You should have known what was coming for you!

756
01:09:36,700 --> 01:09:40,700
 He's not dead yet.

757
01:12:21,700 --> 01:12:25,600
 You're back?

758
01:12:25,600 --> 01:12:29,600
 Morning.

759
01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:35,800
 You're back.

760
01:12:35,800 --> 01:12:39,800
 Morning.

761
01:12:42,500 --> 01:12:44,400
 Aunt, I'm back.

762
01:12:44,400 --> 01:12:48,300
 Has your father written?

763
01:12:48,300 --> 01:12:52,300
 I'll check the mail later.

764
01:13:03,800 --> 01:13:07,800
 Aunt, I'm going to school.

765
01:13:12,500 --> 01:13:14,700
 You're still letting her study?

766
01:13:14,700 --> 01:13:17,400
 I sold off the house her father left for her.

767
01:13:17,400 --> 01:13:20,100
 In return I agreed to let her finish her studies.

768
01:13:20,100 --> 01:13:24,100
 I'm a person who keeps her word.

769
01:14:32,700 --> 01:14:35,600
 It is the time for victory!

770
01:14:35,600 --> 01:14:37,200
 In the past 500 years,

771
01:14:37,200 --> 01:14:39,000
 having endured the tyranny of Imperialism

772
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:42,500
 the whole of Asia has now

773
01:14:42,500 --> 01:14:45,900
 broken free and achieved freedom.

774
01:14:45,900 --> 01:14:48,900
 Asia is now returning to Asians' hands!

775
01:14:48,900 --> 01:14:52,000
 For every day it is not,

776
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:56,000
 we will fight unceasingly for freedom!

777
01:15:38,100 --> 01:15:39,900
 You'd never have expected

778
01:15:39,900 --> 01:15:42,000
 that our actions in Hongkong

779
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:45,000
 were being observed secretly.

780
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:46,100
 After you left that night,

781
01:15:46,100 --> 01:15:49,500
 they appeared and cleaned up the mess.

782
01:15:49,500 --> 01:15:52,000
 They smuggled us out of Hongkong.

783
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:55,000
 Who's they?

784
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:59,000
 They're from Chongqing, they're the ones

785
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:04,000
 who assassinated the Shanghai mayor.

786
01:16:06,300 --> 01:16:10,100
 Now you know how childish we were.

787
01:16:10,100 --> 01:16:12,700
 It was really ridiculous.

788
01:16:12,700 --> 01:16:15,400
 Yes, especially me.

789
01:16:15,400 --> 01:16:19,400
 I was just dumb.

790
01:16:19,700 --> 01:16:23,600
 It was my fault.

791
01:16:23,600 --> 01:16:27,600
 We all paid a price.

792
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:32,500
 How's everyone?

793
01:16:32,500 --> 01:16:35,100
 They're all still around.

794
01:16:35,100 --> 01:16:39,100
 Where?

795
01:16:39,300 --> 01:16:43,300
 A few places. It's not convenient to say.

796
01:16:45,300 --> 01:16:49,300
 I've been looking for you.

797
01:16:52,400 --> 01:16:54,800
 I didn't go back to school.

798
01:16:54,800 --> 01:16:58,800
 I later taught language lessons at a community centre.

799
01:16:58,800 --> 01:17:02,800
It seems I have no memory of that period of time.

800
01:17:03,600 --> 01:17:05,900
My father wrote me a letter,

801
01:17:05,900 --> 01:17:09,000
saying he couldn't afford to send me to England.

802
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:13,000
He wanted me to resume my studies and stay with my aunt in Shanghai.

803
01:17:13,400 --> 01:17:15,200
After the Pacific War broke out,

804
01:17:15,200 --> 01:17:18,300
it became very difficult to leave Hongkong.

805
01:17:18,300 --> 01:17:22,300
I only got my permit this April.

806
01:17:25,500 --> 01:17:27,200
These few years...

807
01:17:27,200 --> 01:17:30,100
I feel like I don't have much left anymore.

808
01:17:30,100 --> 01:17:31,800
That's why I wanted to continue schooling.

809
01:17:31,800 --> 01:17:34,800
Even though I'm forced to learn Japanese.

810
01:17:34,800 --> 01:17:38,200
I'm glad you're back in school.

811
01:17:38,200 --> 01:17:42,200
I'll never be able to again.

812
01:17:46,400 --> 01:17:48,700
Why are you looking for me?

813
01:17:48,700 --> 01:17:52,700
Just to apologise?

814
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:57,900
I have a task at hand.

815
01:17:57,900 --> 01:18:01,900
That incident hasn't been concluded.

816
01:18:04,200 --> 01:18:07,500
Yee is now in charge of Wang Jingwei's spy operations.

817
01:18:07,500 --> 01:18:08,600
On the surface it's maintaning public peace.

818
01:18:08,600 --> 01:18:11,000
But he's just a dog of the Japanese.

819
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:14,100
He kills judges and academics who are anti-Japanese.

820
01:18:14,100 --> 01:18:18,000
Journalists, and our informants too.

821
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:19,600
Three years ago we missed a valuable chance.

822
01:18:19,600 --> 01:18:22,100
Now it's even harder.

823
01:18:22,100 --> 01:18:25,900
His security is tighter than before.

824
01:18:25,900 --> 01:18:29,900
We don't have a chance to get him.

825
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:55,000
Boss, give me a little more won't you?

826
01:18:55,100 --> 01:18:59,100
Don't mess it up.

827
01:19:13,200 --> 01:19:15,500
You can call me Wu.

828
01:19:15,500 --> 01:19:19,000
I believe Kuang Yumin has already talked to you about it.

829
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:23,000
Sit.

830
01:19:27,500 --> 01:19:30,100
Let's get to the point.

831
01:19:30,100 --> 01:19:33,300
First, and also usually last,

832
01:19:33,300 --> 01:19:37,300
Before you go on a mission sew this into your clothes.

833
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:45,000
If your identity is exposed...

834
01:19:46,500 --> 01:19:49,400
It's only a precaution.

835
01:19:49,400 --> 01:19:51,700
It won't be painful, but do it quickly.

836
01:19:51,700 --> 01:19:55,400
Be sure to do it before they restrain your hands. Get it?

837
01:19:55,400 --> 01:19:56,700
Is your memory good?

838
01:19:56,700 --> 01:20:00,600
Remember every single word I say.

839
01:20:00,600 --> 01:20:02,700
Repeat it in your mind.

840
01:20:02,700 --> 01:20:03,800
Don't ask questions, and don't think.

841
01:20:03,800 --> 01:20:05,100
Just remember you're Mrs. Mak.

842
01:20:05,100 --> 01:20:07,900
You've always lived in Hongkong, and have no relatives in Shanghai.

843
01:20:07,900 --> 01:20:10,600
This is very important, you must know

844
01:20:10,600 --> 01:20:13,600
our enemies are very careful and cunning.

845
01:20:13,600 --> 01:20:15,600
Once you arouse his suspicions you'll be dead.

846
01:20:15,600 --> 01:20:19,600
I have to warn you first.

847
01:20:20,800 --> 01:20:24,800
I can do it.

848
01:20:26,400 --> 01:20:27,900
This is your file.

849
01:20:27,900 --> 01:20:30,000
Four years ago you married Mr. Mak.

850
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:33,000
Your marriage certificate, and your wedding anniversary,

851
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:34,400
You live in Luobiancheng street in Hongkong,

852
01:20:34,400 --> 01:20:36,300
and moved to Zhuangshidun street.

853
01:20:36,300 --> 01:20:38,300
After Hongkong fell, Mr. Mak's business took a turn for the worse.

854
01:20:38,300 --> 01:20:42,000
So you had to run errands to make ends meet.

855
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:43,300
Your telephone numbers.

856
01:20:43,300 --> 01:20:45,900
For home, and Mr. Mak's office.

857
01:20:45,900 --> 01:20:47,900
Which goods were in scarce supply in Hongkong last year,

858
01:20:47,900 --> 01:20:50,000
and what you can't buy in Shanghai.

859
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:52,400
Your bank account number.

860
01:20:52,400 --> 01:20:54,500
You need to commit all of these to memory.

861
01:20:54,500 --> 01:20:55,900
You need to be able to answer unhesitatingly.

862
01:20:55,900 --> 01:20:59,200
This is only the first step. You need to know that

863
01:20:59,200 --> 01:21:03,200
once you start, you can't look back.

864
01:21:15,600 --> 01:21:16,700
Silk stockings, western medicine.

865
01:21:16,700 --> 01:21:19,300
You need to remember the prices of everything on the list.

866
01:21:19,300 --> 01:21:21,400
My job ends here.

867
01:21:21,400 --> 01:21:25,400
The rest is up to you. Any questions?

868
01:21:25,400 --> 01:21:27,200
I wrote a letter to my father.

869
01:21:27,200 --> 01:21:31,200
Could you mail it to him after you read it?

870
01:21:31,700 --> 01:21:35,700
Once you complete your task, we'll send you to England.

871
01:21:39,300 --> 01:21:41,800
You should go dress up.

872
01:21:41,800 --> 01:21:45,800
I want to see Mrs. Mak.

873
01:21:49,300 --> 01:21:51,400
What about your part?

874
01:21:51,400 --> 01:21:52,600
The car's ready.

875
01:21:52,600 --> 01:21:54,100
The hotel room's paid up for a week.

876
01:21:54,100 --> 01:21:55,900
It's the Wang government's HQ.

877
01:21:55,900 --> 01:21:57,300
Mrs. Yee often eats there.

878
01:21:57,300 --> 01:22:01,300
We'll let them meet there.

879
01:22:28,100 --> 01:22:32,100
Wait for me in the study. Yes sir.

880
01:22:47,100 --> 01:22:48,400
She's been to Shanghai a few times already.

881
01:22:48,400 --> 01:22:50,700
She stayed at East Asia Hotel but we never knew.

882
01:22:50,700 --> 01:22:52,200
Sorry about that.

883
01:22:52,200 --> 01:22:53,600
If Mr. Mak wasn't so busy,

884
01:22:53,600 --> 01:22:55,200
I'd have contacted you earlier.

885
01:22:55,200 --> 01:22:56,800
I said our house was just empty rooms,

886
01:22:56,800 --> 01:23:00,200
staying in a hotel was just a waste of money.

887
01:23:00,200 --> 01:23:03,800
I haven't been to Hongkong for ages.

888
01:23:03,800 --> 01:23:04,700
You're back?

889
01:23:04,700 --> 01:23:07,600
Do you remember Mrs. Mak?

890
01:23:07,600 --> 01:23:11,600
Mr. Yee, how are you? You must have forgotten me.

891
01:23:11,800 --> 01:23:12,900
I haven't.

892
01:23:12,900 --> 01:23:15,700
How's Mr. Mak and his business?

893
01:23:15,700 --> 01:23:18,600
Times are tough. Thanks for asking.

894
01:23:18,600 --> 01:23:20,200
Mr. Yee seems to have lost weight.

895
01:23:20,200 --> 01:23:22,300
When he got his posting I asked him to reconsider it.

896
01:23:22,300 --> 01:23:25,600
It's nothing but hard work and offending people.

897
01:23:25,600 --> 01:23:29,600
You women go ahead.

898
01:23:30,400 --> 01:23:33,000
He's quite friendly isn't he?

899
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:37,000
It's just acting.

900
01:23:37,400 --> 01:23:40,900
Are we still going to East Asia today? Aren't you sick of the food there?

901
01:23:40,900 --> 01:23:43,800
It's safer with the Special Ops people there.

902
01:23:43,800 --> 01:23:44,900
Why?

903
01:23:44,900 --> 01:23:47,200
Bombs. It's chaotic out there.

904
01:23:47,200 --> 01:23:51,100
Any suspicious characters are shot on the spot.

905
01:23:51,100 --> 01:23:53,800
My siblings are in Singapore,

906
01:23:53,800 --> 01:23:56,000
they told me it's going to the dogs there.

907
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:57,500
They told me not to come.

908
01:23:57,500 --> 01:24:00,100
Is Hongkong better?

909
01:24:00,100 --> 01:24:03,200
It's the same, prices have doubled.

910
01:24:03,200 --> 01:24:06,400
Because of the war, the black market is flourishing.

911
01:24:06,400 --> 01:24:08,100
Oh, you don't smoke.

912
01:24:08,100 --> 01:24:10,300
I brought some ciggies for you.

913
01:24:10,300 --> 01:24:12,100
It's in my luggage, I almost forgot.

914
01:24:12,100 --> 01:24:15,800
Thanks! You can't even get it on the black market now.

915
01:24:15,800 --> 01:24:19,800
Yes, Minister.

916
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:56,000
The room's a little cramped, but it's safer here.

917
01:24:57,300 --> 01:24:59,900
I was afraid of inconveniencing you and Mrs. Yee.

918
01:24:59,900 --> 01:25:03,900
It's her pleasure to have someone play mahjong with her. I'm also hardly at home.

919
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:11,000
Have you been busy? You've lost a lot of weight.

920
01:25:19,400 --> 01:25:23,400
You've changed too.

921
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:32,000
It's been three years and the war isn't over.

922
01:25:32,900 --> 01:25:36,900
It's no easy feat that we could still meet.

923
01:25:41,500 --> 01:25:44,800
I brought some stuff for Mrs. Yee.

924
01:25:44,800 --> 01:25:48,400
I didn't know what you like.

925
01:25:48,400 --> 01:25:52,400
It's good enough that you're here.

926
01:26:19,600 --> 01:26:21,600
The map of the Yees' residence. The front is blocked.

927
01:26:21,600 --> 01:26:23,500
Everyone enters and leaves via the back.

928
01:26:23,500 --> 01:26:25,100
There're two chaffeurs, Guo and Yao.

929
01:26:25,100 --> 01:26:26,300
Guo drives Mrs. Yee.

930
01:26:26,300 --> 01:26:28,300
Ah Ma and the servants are from Yee's hometown.

931
01:26:28,300 --> 01:26:31,600
The chaffeur never leaves the car, not sure if he's Yee's eyes.

932
01:26:31,600 --> 01:26:34,300
All belongings have to be searched before boarding the car.

933
01:26:34,300 --> 01:26:36,500
What about Yee?

934
01:26:36,500 --> 01:26:40,200
I met him once, he's rarely at home.

935
01:26:40,200 --> 01:26:44,200
When he comes home he'll go to the study. I haven't found a chance yet.

936
01:26:45,300 --> 01:26:47,100
He has a secretary, Zhang.

937
01:26:47,100 --> 01:26:48,300
What's his full name?

938
01:26:48,300 --> 01:26:50,200
I don't know yet.

939
01:26:50,200 --> 01:26:53,300
You must be careful.

940
01:26:53,300 --> 01:26:55,800
I need money.

941
01:26:55,800 --> 01:26:59,800
Take this for the time being.

942
01:26:59,900 --> 01:27:03,800
How come you haven't gotten any better even though you play mahjong every day?

943
01:27:03,800 --> 01:27:07,800
I need to remember so many things, I can't concentrate.

944
01:27:11,300 --> 01:27:15,300
What about the rest? How are they?

945
01:27:15,400 --> 01:27:19,400
They're all concerned about you. You'll meet them eventually.

946
01:27:22,900 --> 01:27:24,600
Fortunately you didn't come to the opera with me yesterday.

947
01:27:24,600 --> 01:27:26,500
It made my head hurt.

948
01:27:26,500 --> 01:27:28,400
What did they sing yesterday?

949
01:27:28,400 --> 01:27:32,200
Wu Jia Po. It was terrible singing.

950
01:27:32,200 --> 01:27:34,200
All the good singers have fled to Hongkong.

951
01:27:34,200 --> 01:27:36,800
I told Mr. Yee that if the government of his,

952
01:27:36,800 --> 01:27:39,200
can't even bring in a decent opera,

953
01:27:39,200 --> 01:27:42,200
no matter how much good they do, the people won't acknowledge it.

954
01:27:42,200 --> 01:27:44,100
Morning.

955
01:27:44,100 --> 01:27:48,100
Good morning, Mr. Yee.

956
01:27:49,200 --> 01:27:51,500
The Chinese herbs you've been taking contains turtle shell and staghorn.

957
01:27:51,500 --> 01:27:54,600
You shouldn't drink tea with it.

958
01:27:54,600 --> 01:27:58,400
His feet get cold so he can't sleep well. He's taking it to improve his blood circulation.

959
01:27:58,400 --> 01:28:02,400
He asks me to massage his feet in the night.

960
01:28:02,700 --> 01:28:04,700
I'm having a meeting soon.

961
01:28:04,700 --> 01:28:07,100
What're you doing today?

962
01:28:07,100 --> 01:28:11,100
I'm going to Mrs. Liao's to play mahjong with her Mum.

963
01:28:12,100 --> 01:28:14,900
You're not forcing our guest to go, are you?

964
01:28:14,900 --> 01:28:16,200
Mrs. Yee is giving me a break today.

965
01:28:16,200 --> 01:28:20,200
I'm going to the movies in the afternoon.

966
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:42,000
Mr. Yee asked me to fetch you because it's raining.

967
01:28:56,600 --> 01:29:00,600
Are we going to the cinema?

968
01:29:24,800 --> 01:29:28,800
The car will be waiting for you here.

969
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:51,000
Don't scare me like that!

970
01:31:45,800 --> 01:31:47,900
My hair!

971
01:31:47,900 --> 01:31:51,800
Is it so difficult?

972
01:31:51,800 --> 01:31:55,200
Do you like it this way?

973
01:31:55,200 --> 01:31:59,200
Sit down.

974
01:32:00,300 --> 01:32:04,300
Sit down.

975
01:34:44,700 --> 01:34:48,700
Your coat.

976
01:35:49,500 --> 01:35:50,900
What brings you here Yee?

977
01:35:50,900 --> 01:35:52,400
I was with a guest in the next room.

978
01:35:52,400 --> 01:35:56,100
Ah, Mr. Yee caught us shopping.

979
01:35:56,100 --> 01:35:59,400
Sit down with us since you're here.

980
01:35:59,400 --> 01:36:03,400
I'll accompany you women for a while.

981
01:36:13,200 --> 01:36:15,900
Do you understand the Suzhou dialect?

982
01:36:15,900 --> 01:36:19,400
A little, I liked listening to it when I was young.

983
01:36:19,400 --> 01:36:23,400
But after we moved to Hongkong I didn't get to any more.

984
01:36:23,700 --> 01:36:27,600
But you're back now, aren't you?

985
01:36:27,600 --> 01:36:31,600
It's temporary. I'll be going back to Hongkong soon.

986
01:36:31,900 --> 01:36:34,600
I'll be going in a few days. If there's anything you want,

987
01:36:34,600 --> 01:36:38,600
I can bring some back for you.

988
01:36:59,200 --> 01:37:03,200
CUTE DOG!

989
01:37:16,500 --> 01:37:19,100
Mrs. Mak, will you be having breakfast?

990
01:37:19,100 --> 01:37:21,300
I'm not hungry, thank you.

991
01:37:21,300 --> 01:37:22,200
Where are Mr. and Mrs. Yee?

992
01:37:22,200 --> 01:37:26,200
Mrs. Yee isn't awake yet. Mr. Yee has already left for Nanjing for a meeting.

993
01:37:27,800 --> 01:37:29,000
To Nanjing eh?

994
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:30,800
Yes.

995
01:37:30,800 --> 01:37:32,400
When will he be back?

996
01:37:32,400 --> 01:37:36,400
I don't know.

997
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:45,700
Mrs. Liang took a fall, I'm going to see her.

998
01:37:45,700 --> 01:37:47,400
Mrs. Mak has been having a headache for the past two days.

999
01:37:47,400 --> 01:37:49,400
When she wakes up give her some medicine.

1000
01:37:49,400 --> 01:37:52,200
I'll be out the whole day. Take care of the house.

1001
01:37:52,200 --> 01:37:54,700
If Mrs. Mak feels like eating give her some porridge.

1002
01:37:54,700 --> 01:37:58,700
Got it.

1003
01:39:04,200 --> 01:39:08,200
Do you believe that I hate you?

1004
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:14,000
I do.

1005
01:39:20,300 --> 01:39:24,000
It wasn't like this three years ago.

1006
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:26,000
I hate you.

1007
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:27,900
I said I believe you.

1008
01:39:27,900 --> 01:39:31,300
I haven't believed anyone for a long time.

1009
01:39:31,300 --> 01:39:35,300
Say it once more. I'll believe you.

1010
01:39:35,700 --> 01:39:38,500
Then you must be very lonely.

1011
01:39:38,500 --> 01:39:42,500
But I'm still alive.

1012
01:39:44,600 --> 01:39:47,500
You left for four days without a word.

1013
01:39:47,500 --> 01:39:51,500
Do you know I was hating you every minute?

1014
01:39:52,600 --> 01:39:56,600
Now that I'm back, do you still hate me?

1015
01:39:58,700 --> 01:40:02,700
No.

1016
01:40:03,600 --> 01:40:07,600
Are you still going back to Hongkong?

1017
01:40:07,700 --> 01:40:11,700
I want to go back.

1018
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:16,000
Give me an apartment.

1019
01:43:47,500 --> 01:43:51,500
Brother, you can't do something illegal like this!

1020
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:56,000
I...I didn't. Why are you here?

1021
01:43:56,600 --> 01:43:58,400
I went to the teahouse to find you.

1022
01:43:58,400 --> 01:44:00,900
Our branch members have been taken into custody.

1023
01:44:00,900 --> 01:44:02,600
Some of our safe houses have been raided.

1024
01:44:02,600 --> 01:44:04,400
Fortunately Ouyang was alert enough to escape.

1025
01:44:04,400 --> 01:44:06,500
All our lines of communication have to be cut.

1026
01:44:06,500 --> 01:44:10,000
You can't go back to the old places.

1027
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:14,000
Then when will we act?

1028
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:18,000
We need to wait for orders from the top.

1029
01:44:19,500 --> 01:44:21,700
Can you hurry them?

1030
01:44:21,700 --> 01:44:25,400
After all this, can we all leave this place?

1031
01:44:25,400 --> 01:44:29,400
I can't say. I don't know.

1032
01:44:34,400 --> 01:44:36,000
I haven't seen him for the last few days.

1033
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:38,200
Ah Ma says he went to Nanjing.

1034
01:44:38,200 --> 01:44:42,200
I don't know if that's true.

1035
01:44:42,300 --> 01:44:45,100
He might have another woman.

1036
01:44:45,100 --> 01:44:48,200
The previous day he brought me to No. 1237 Xia Fei Road...

1037
01:44:48,200 --> 01:44:52,200
I know, we had people there.

1038
01:44:57,700 --> 01:45:00,300
There was perfume in the apartment.

1039
01:45:00,300 --> 01:45:03,800
There was a smell of jasmine flowers nearby.

1040
01:45:03,800 --> 01:45:07,800
But it didn't seem like it was left there on that day.

1041
01:45:07,900 --> 01:45:10,600
There was dust on the pillows.

1042
01:45:10,600 --> 01:45:12,500
I don't know.

1043
01:45:12,500 --> 01:45:14,600
Wong Chia Chi...

1044
01:45:14,600 --> 01:45:15,700
I don't know...

1045
01:45:15,700 --> 01:45:17,600
Wong Chia Chi, Wong Chia Chi!

1046
01:45:17,600 --> 01:45:21,600
Look at me, look at me!

1047
01:45:23,400 --> 01:45:27,400
I won't let you be harmed, understand?

1048
01:45:28,700 --> 01:45:32,700
I won't let you get hurt.

1049
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:48,100
She said I'm old already but you're still flirting with me !

1050
01:45:48,100 --> 01:45:52,100
I said Old tofu is the best!

1051
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:55,100
Since it's Mr. Yee's birthday,

1052
01:45:55,100 --> 01:45:58,400
she toasted him for longetivity.

1053
01:45:58,400 --> 01:46:00,200
I haven't seen Mr. Yee for the past few days.

1054
01:46:00,200 --> 01:46:01,900
He's gone to Nanjing on official business.

1055
01:46:01,900 --> 01:46:05,700
Well, even though you say she's old she still looks good.

1056
01:46:05,700 --> 01:46:09,700
But Qianchu's is really bad.

1057
01:46:41,700 --> 01:46:45,700
Close the door.

1058
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:17,000
I was waiting for you.

1059
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:23,000
You must be tired then.

1060
01:47:23,000 --> 01:47:25,500
I'm very tired.

1061
01:47:25,500 --> 01:47:27,000
Mrs. Yee said you went to Nanjing.

1062
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:29,000
Don't believe what you hear.

1063
01:47:29,000 --> 01:47:32,600
I've been very busy these few days.

1064
01:47:32,600 --> 01:47:34,800
We broke a resistance cell in Chongqing.

1065
01:47:34,800 --> 01:47:37,500
And arrested ten of them.

1066
01:47:37,500 --> 01:47:40,300
They'd gone through rigorous training.

1067
01:47:40,300 --> 01:47:44,100
So I had to personally interrogate them one by one

1068
01:47:44,100 --> 01:47:48,100
to get anything out of them.

1069
01:47:51,100 --> 01:47:53,000
Ah, I forgot

1070
01:47:53,000 --> 01:47:56,700
you're not interested in my work are you?

1071
01:47:56,700 --> 01:47:59,500
It's very boring.

1072
01:47:59,500 --> 01:48:01,200
You've been very careful all this while

1073
01:48:01,200 --> 01:48:05,200
not to ask me about it.

1074
01:48:06,700 --> 01:48:09,100
That's your business.

1075
01:48:09,100 --> 01:48:11,400
You never ask about me too.

1076
01:48:11,400 --> 01:48:15,400
The only thing I can do is to wait for you here every day.

1077
01:48:18,800 --> 01:48:20,900
Maybe you have another woman outside.

1078
01:48:20,900 --> 01:48:23,900
I can't sleep, if this continues

1079
01:48:23,900 --> 01:48:27,900
you'll be bored of me too.

1080
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:35,600
You've been busy thinking of this these few days?

1081
01:48:35,600 --> 01:48:38,200
And I've been losing a lot at mahjong.

1082
01:48:38,200 --> 01:48:40,000
The hard-earned money I've made,

1083
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:44,000
I've lost almost all of it.

1084
01:48:46,800 --> 01:48:49,100
I should go back to bed.

1085
01:48:49,100 --> 01:48:53,100
Get some rest.

1086
01:48:54,400 --> 01:48:58,400
I'll bring you to a better place tomorrow.

1087
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:10,000
Don't come into this room again.

1088
01:49:21,700 --> 01:49:25,700
Make way!

1089
01:50:13,900 --> 01:50:15,500
Let's go back.

1090
01:50:15,500 --> 01:50:19,000
The Minister said to wait for him.

1091
01:50:19,000 --> 01:50:23,000
It's been two hours already.

1092
01:50:43,000 --> 01:50:45,900
Two people came in at the last minute.

1093
01:50:45,900 --> 01:50:49,900
Drive.

1094
01:51:07,000 --> 01:51:11,000
It's very cold outside. You could have let me wait inside.

1095
01:51:13,900 --> 01:51:17,900
Wait inside?

1096
01:51:20,100 --> 01:51:24,100
You want to go into that place?

1097
01:51:27,100 --> 01:51:28,700
You really want to go into where I work?

1098
01:51:28,700 --> 01:51:32,700
I know, forget it.

1099
01:51:33,000 --> 01:51:35,800
Why are you looking at me like that?

1100
01:51:35,800 --> 01:51:39,000
You shouldn't be so beautiful.

1101
01:51:39,000 --> 01:51:43,000
I was thinking of you today. My secretary said I was distracted.

1102
01:51:44,300 --> 01:51:46,400
He was reporting to me,

1103
01:51:46,400 --> 01:51:48,500
but I only saw his mouth moving.

1104
01:51:48,500 --> 01:51:52,500
Not a word went into my head.

1105
01:51:52,600 --> 01:51:55,600
I can smell your fragrance.

1106
01:51:55,600 --> 01:51:59,500
I couldn't concentrate.

1107
01:51:59,500 --> 01:52:01,500
Those two people,

1108
01:52:01,500 --> 01:52:04,600
We arrested them at the bus stop.

1109
01:52:04,600 --> 01:52:08,600
They're key members from the Chongqing cell.

1110
01:52:09,000 --> 01:52:11,800
He killed some of our people.

1111
01:52:11,800 --> 01:52:13,500
When we were arresting them,

1112
01:52:13,500 --> 01:52:15,800
we bludgeoned one of them till his brains spilled out.

1113
01:52:15,800 --> 01:52:19,800
And we still had to drag him back for questioning.

1114
01:52:21,100 --> 01:52:23,300
I went down with secretary Zhang.

1115
01:52:23,300 --> 01:52:25,500
One of them had already died.

1116
01:52:25,500 --> 01:52:28,900
Half of his head was gone, and his eyeballs were a pulp.

1117
01:52:28,900 --> 01:52:32,400
I recognised the other one, he was a classmate from the party school.

1118
01:52:32,400 --> 01:52:35,300
I saw his hands chained to the posts.

1119
01:52:35,300 --> 01:52:37,800
I couldn't say anything.

1120
01:52:37,800 --> 01:52:38,900
What came to my mind

1121
01:52:38,900 --> 01:52:41,800
was he screwing you.

1122
01:52:41,800 --> 01:52:45,400
The bastard's blood sprayed onto my leather shoes.

1123
01:52:45,400 --> 01:52:49,400
Do you know I had to clean them before I came out?

1124
01:55:43,400 --> 01:55:46,200
He really agreed to give you an apartment?

1125
01:55:46,200 --> 01:55:50,000
I already told Mrs. Yee, I'm moving out next weekend.

1126
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:53,500
He was there, I don't think he'll go back on his word.

1127
01:55:53,500 --> 01:55:57,500
That's great. That old pervert finally let his guard down.

1128
01:55:58,200 --> 01:56:01,000
Once we have a fixed location it'll be easier to make a move.

1129
01:56:01,000 --> 01:56:02,700
There's no hurry.

1130
01:56:02,700 --> 01:56:04,500
What are we waiting for?

1131
01:56:04,500 --> 01:56:07,300
We need information. He broke our source of information,

1132
01:56:07,300 --> 01:56:09,800
and took our advanced American arms.

1133
01:56:09,800 --> 01:56:12,100
We suffered a great loss.

1134
01:56:12,100 --> 01:56:15,400
The strange thing is, even the Japanese are looking for these arms.

1135
01:56:15,400 --> 01:56:16,800
Wong Chia Chi is very important to us.

1136
01:56:16,800 --> 01:56:18,400
We must make full use of her.

1137
01:56:18,400 --> 01:56:20,700
But she has never undergone proper training.

1138
01:56:20,700 --> 01:56:23,000
She can't take the long-term strain.

1139
01:56:23,000 --> 01:56:25,900
You underestimate her. Her strength

1140
01:56:25,900 --> 01:56:29,900
lies in her ability to play Mrs. Mak.

1141
01:56:30,200 --> 01:56:31,900
It's no mean feat that she got to this point.

1142
01:56:31,900 --> 01:56:33,500
The superiors value her greatly.

1143
01:56:33,500 --> 01:56:37,500
We had two trained female comrades who hooked him for a while,

1144
01:56:38,100 --> 01:56:41,400
But he found them out and killed them.

1145
01:56:41,400 --> 01:56:42,800
We even lost a namelist to them.

1146
01:56:42,800 --> 01:56:44,800
You don't understand how dangerous her situation is.

1147
01:56:44,800 --> 01:56:47,400
She agreed to seduce Yee, and she's done it.

1148
01:56:47,400 --> 01:56:48,800
Now is the time for action!

1149
01:56:48,800 --> 01:56:50,400
Don't tell me when to take action!

1150
01:56:50,400 --> 01:56:54,100
Listen up, Yee killed my wife

1151
01:56:54,100 --> 01:56:56,400
and my two kids, but I could still

1152
01:56:56,400 --> 01:56:58,200
sit at the same table and have a meal with him.

1153
01:56:58,200 --> 01:57:00,200
This is the life of a spy!

1154
01:57:00,200 --> 01:57:03,100
I would like better than no one else to kill him now.

1155
01:57:03,100 --> 01:57:07,100
As long as he has value to us alive, I will let him live.

1156
01:57:09,900 --> 01:57:13,000
Continue baiting him, and report back regularly.

1157
01:57:13,000 --> 01:57:16,400
Don't move without my orders.

1158
01:57:16,400 --> 01:57:17,300
Remember.

1159
01:57:17,300 --> 01:57:19,500
A resistance agent only has one motivation:

1160
01:57:19,500 --> 01:57:21,000
loyalty.

1161
01:57:21,000 --> 01:57:25,000
Loyalty to the party, to the leaders, to the country. Understand?

1162
01:57:27,000 --> 01:57:31,000
Don't worry, I'll act accordingly.

1163
01:57:34,100 --> 01:57:36,300
Good.

1164
01:57:36,300 --> 01:57:39,100
You only need to continue luring him into the trap.

1165
01:57:39,100 --> 01:57:40,100
If there's a need,

1166
01:57:40,100 --> 01:57:42,800
What do you think this trap is?

1167
01:57:42,800 --> 01:57:46,800
My body? Who do you think he is?

1168
01:57:47,100 --> 01:57:50,500
He knows how to act better than you guys.

1169
01:57:50,500 --> 01:57:54,500
He not only wants to be inside my body,

1170
01:57:54,500 --> 01:57:58,500
but worms his way into my heart like a snake.

1171
01:57:58,900 --> 01:58:02,000
I'm like his slave, allowing him in.

1172
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:04,700
I can only loyally wait, playing my role,

1173
01:58:04,700 --> 01:58:07,400
to get into his heart.

1174
01:58:07,400 --> 01:58:11,400
He'll make me bleed and cry in agony,

1175
01:58:12,900 --> 01:58:15,200
before he's satisfied.

1176
01:58:15,200 --> 01:58:18,900
That's the only way he can feel alive.

1177
01:58:18,900 --> 01:58:22,900
In the darkness, only he knows this is all real.

1178
01:58:23,700 --> 01:58:25,200
That's enough.

1179
01:58:25,200 --> 01:58:27,300
That's why

1180
01:58:27,300 --> 01:58:29,400
That's why I can let myself be tortured to breaking point,

1181
01:58:29,400 --> 01:58:32,700
and still continue, till I can't take it any further.

1182
01:58:32,700 --> 01:58:34,100
That's enough.

1183
01:58:34,100 --> 01:58:36,400
Every time after the final spasm,

1184
01:58:36,400 --> 01:58:38,800
I think, will it be this time?

1185
01:58:38,800 --> 01:58:41,400
Will our people rush in and blow his brains out?

1186
01:58:41,400 --> 01:58:43,600
And his blood and brains will spill all over me.

1187
01:58:43,600 --> 01:58:47,600
Stop it!

1188
01:59:38,200 --> 01:59:42,200
Was it Mr. Yee's plan to bring me to the Japanese district?

1189
02:00:08,800 --> 02:00:12,800
Good evening.

1190
02:00:13,100 --> 02:00:14,900
Welcome.

1191
02:00:14,900 --> 02:00:16,500
I'm looking for Mr. Yee.

1192
02:00:16,500 --> 02:00:20,500
This way please.

1193
02:00:40,200 --> 02:00:41,800
Pretty girl isn't she!

1194
02:00:41,800 --> 02:00:45,800
Come here.

1195
02:00:46,400 --> 02:00:50,400
Lieutenant Colonel Nakamura...

1196
02:00:50,900 --> 02:00:54,300
Sorry!

1197
02:00:54,300 --> 02:00:58,300
Even the girls are dumping you!

1198
02:01:02,500 --> 02:01:05,700
This is a customer, not one of our girls.

1199
02:01:05,700 --> 02:01:08,500
Keiko, go accompany Colonel Nakamura.

1200
02:01:08,500 --> 02:01:12,500
Get some more sake.

1201
02:01:15,500 --> 02:01:19,500
My apologies.

1202
02:01:22,500 --> 02:01:26,500
Sorry for that.

1203
02:01:37,800 --> 02:01:41,800
Your guest is here.

1204
02:01:48,700 --> 02:01:52,700
I'm punishing myself by waiting for you this time.

1205
02:01:52,700 --> 02:01:54,400
Why here?

1206
02:01:54,400 --> 02:01:58,400
Official business.

1207
02:02:32,100 --> 02:02:36,100
They sound like they're crying.

1208
02:02:37,500 --> 02:02:41,200
The Japs kill people indiscriminately, but actually they're more afraid than anyone else.

1209
02:02:41,200 --> 02:02:43,300
They know that eventually, once they start fighting with the Americans,

1210
02:02:43,300 --> 02:02:47,300
it'll be over. And all these actors

1211
02:02:49,100 --> 02:02:53,100
are still frivolously singing their opera.

1212
02:02:54,300 --> 02:02:58,300
Just listen.

1213
02:03:20,200 --> 02:03:23,800
I know why you asked me here.

1214
02:03:23,800 --> 02:03:25,400
Why?

1215
02:03:25,400 --> 02:03:29,400
You want me to be your whore.

1216
02:03:29,500 --> 02:03:32,800
Whore?

1217
02:03:32,800 --> 02:03:36,800
I brought you here to see how good a geisha you'd make.

1218
02:03:47,100 --> 02:03:51,100
I'll sing a song for you. I sing better than them.

1219
02:03:51,300 --> 02:03:55,300
Really?

1220
02:04:57,100 --> 02:05:01,100
Tears stain my sleeve,

1221
02:05:02,800 --> 02:05:06,800
This girl has been thinking of him all the while till now.

1222
02:06:57,900 --> 02:07:01,800
Go back first, I still have work to do.

1223
02:07:01,800 --> 02:07:05,800
So late?

1224
02:07:07,000 --> 02:07:11,000
I have a favour to ask you.

1225
02:07:11,600 --> 02:07:14,400
Tomorrow, bring this letter to this address.

1226
02:07:14,400 --> 02:07:16,900
Look for a man called Hali Salahuddin.

1227
02:07:16,900 --> 02:07:20,600
Can you remember that?

1228
02:07:20,600 --> 02:07:22,700
Hali Salahuddin...

1229
02:07:22,700 --> 02:07:24,400
If he says something to you,

1230
02:07:24,400 --> 02:07:28,400
or gives your something, tell me.

1231
02:07:29,100 --> 02:07:33,100
Keep it a secret between the two of us.

1232
02:08:08,700 --> 02:08:12,700
It's a name card. Only Yee's name is on it.

1233
02:08:16,100 --> 02:08:19,300
Put it back. What do you think?

1234
02:08:19,300 --> 02:08:21,900
I'm afraid Wong Chia Chi is under suspicion.

1235
02:08:21,900 --> 02:08:25,900
If we send some men down to scout the area we might fall into his trap.

1236
02:08:28,000 --> 02:08:31,200
If Wong Chia Chi goes alone it'll be dangerous too.

1237
02:08:31,200 --> 02:08:35,200
It's best that we keep a lookout outside.

1238
02:08:39,000 --> 02:08:43,000
You should go quickly.

1239
02:08:55,600 --> 02:08:59,600
Wong Chia Chi, I'm really sorry.

1240
02:09:20,300 --> 02:09:22,800
You could have done it three years ago.

1241
02:09:22,800 --> 02:09:26,800
Why didn't you?

1242
02:13:24,400 --> 02:13:28,400
Good stuff!

1243
02:13:44,900 --> 02:13:48,800
Hello, second brother? It's me.

1244
02:13:48,800 --> 02:13:52,800
I'm at Keseling's cafe now. Is everything alright at home?

1245
02:13:53,700 --> 02:13:55,000
Yes.

1246
02:13:55,000 --> 02:13:57,000
I'm good, just too busy recently

1247
02:13:57,000 --> 02:14:01,000
to call back home.

1248
02:14:01,000 --> 02:14:05,000
I'm going to go shopping today. I have a date, I'm going now.

1249
02:14:06,200 --> 02:14:09,000
Ok.

1250
02:14:09,000 --> 02:14:13,000
Well, then, there's nothing else.

1251
02:14:13,100 --> 02:14:17,100
I know, it'll be ok.

1252
02:14:18,400 --> 02:14:22,400
I'm going, goodbye.

1253
02:16:04,400 --> 02:16:05,800
You're late.

1254
02:16:05,800 --> 02:16:09,800
To Fu Kai Shen Road.

1255
02:16:20,400 --> 02:16:21,700
Let's drop by the jewellery shop first.

1256
02:16:21,700 --> 02:16:25,700
It's just nearby. The ring should be ready.

1257
02:16:26,900 --> 02:16:30,900
Turn back.

1258
02:17:04,800 --> 02:17:08,800
Wait here for me.

1259
02:17:44,100 --> 02:17:46,100
What's wrong?

1260
02:17:46,100 --> 02:17:50,100
Nothing.

1261
02:19:14,300 --> 02:19:17,000
Do you like the one I chose?

1262
02:19:17,000 --> 02:19:19,600
I'm not interested in jewels.

1263
02:19:19,600 --> 02:19:23,600
I only want to see it on your finger.

1264
02:19:47,700 --> 02:19:51,700
Wear it.

1265
02:19:54,300 --> 02:19:58,300
I don't want to wear such a valuable thing on the streets.

1266
02:20:02,100 --> 02:20:06,100
You're with me.

1267
02:20:48,300 --> 02:20:52,300
Go, now.

1268
02:21:01,600 --> 02:21:05,600
Open the car door!

1269
02:22:34,600 --> 02:22:37,200
Miss, get on.

1270
02:22:37,200 --> 02:22:38,600
Where to?

1271
02:22:38,600 --> 02:22:42,600
Fu Kai Shen Road.

1272
02:23:01,700 --> 02:23:05,700
Going home?

1273
02:23:06,800 --> 02:23:10,800
Yes.

1274
02:23:38,100 --> 02:23:42,100
They're blocking the road again.

1275
02:23:47,600 --> 02:23:51,600
Stop, stop.

1276
02:23:53,200 --> 02:23:54,700
It can't be helped.

1277
02:23:54,700 --> 02:23:58,700
We have to wait.

1278
02:24:02,200 --> 02:24:06,200
Let me through.

1279
02:24:07,900 --> 02:24:10,400
I need to go home to cook.

1280
02:24:10,400 --> 02:24:14,400
They'll let you through to see a doctor, not to cook!

1281
02:24:29,800 --> 02:24:33,800
Wong Chia Chi.

1282
02:24:35,300 --> 02:24:39,300
Come up.

1283
02:25:01,100 --> 02:25:03,500
A bunch of college students, six of them.

1284
02:25:03,500 --> 02:25:06,100
They were part of a patriotic drama troupe in Hongkong.

1285
02:25:06,100 --> 02:25:10,100
The woman is Wong Chia Chi, she was in the papers in Hongkong.

1286
02:25:10,300 --> 02:25:13,900
The leader is Kuang, we've been tracking him for some time already.

1287
02:25:13,900 --> 02:25:17,900
Too bad we didn't get Wu, he escaped.

1288
02:25:17,900 --> 02:25:20,400
The shooter could have escaped from the rear of the Peace Theatre.

1289
02:25:20,400 --> 02:25:22,800
When we checked they all had movie tickets to fit in.

1290
02:25:22,800 --> 02:25:26,800
These students,

1291
02:25:28,100 --> 02:25:30,400
You're very informed about it aren't you?

1292
02:25:30,400 --> 02:25:34,400
Why didn't you tell me before?

1293
02:25:38,000 --> 02:25:42,000
Because of your relationship with Miss Wong.

1294
02:25:43,400 --> 02:25:46,600
Of course, it's all clear now.

1295
02:25:46,600 --> 02:25:49,700
I left her in the interrogation room.

1296
02:25:49,700 --> 02:25:53,700
Do you want to interrogate her personally?

1297
02:25:54,600 --> 02:25:57,700
She's downstairs?

1298
02:25:57,700 --> 02:26:01,100
Luo and Ban are watching her.

1299
02:26:01,100 --> 02:26:03,400
The rest have been sentenced.

1300
02:26:03,400 --> 02:26:07,300
It was simple, their confessions matched.

1301
02:26:07,300 --> 02:26:10,400
Then there's nothing left for me to ask.

1302
02:26:10,400 --> 02:26:14,400
We've gotten all there is to know right?

1303
02:26:17,000 --> 02:26:21,000
How shall we settle them?

1304
02:26:31,300 --> 02:26:35,300
The northern quarry.

1305
02:26:35,500 --> 02:26:39,500
News blackout, get it done by 10.

1306
02:26:58,500 --> 02:27:02,300
Your ring.

1307
02:27:02,300 --> 02:27:06,300
It's not mine.

1308
02:27:55,800 --> 02:27:59,800
Kneel down!

1309
02:29:01,500 --> 02:29:04,900
It's either Hunan or Sichuan dishes. They're too spicy!

1310
02:29:04,900 --> 02:29:08,900
If you don't eat spicy food how are you going to win hot?

1311
02:29:38,900 --> 02:29:41,100
What happened?

1312
02:29:41,100 --> 02:29:43,700
Today evening secretary Zhang and two guys from your department

1313
02:29:43,700 --> 02:29:47,700
came and took away her things.

1314
02:29:48,800 --> 02:29:52,800
And some things from the study.

1315
02:29:55,400 --> 02:29:58,800
Keep a lid on it.

1316
02:29:58,800 --> 02:30:02,800
If anyone asks, say Mrs. Mak went back to Hongkong on urgent business.

1317
02:30:07,400 --> 02:30:11,400
What happened?

1318
02:30:15,300 --> 02:30:17,300
Go down first.

1319
02:30:17,300 --> 02:30:21,300
Continue playing.
