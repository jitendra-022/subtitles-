1
00:00:01,914 --> 00:00:04,139
Did you have something
to do with Vera getting busted?

2
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:05,379
Who told you to put your business

3
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:09,221
- anywhere near social media?
- My aspirational little brother.

4
00:00:10,119 --> 00:00:11,677
Someone's gonna get hurt for this.

5
00:00:11,678 --> 00:00:14,414
- What happened to Angela?
- She's not gonna work out for us.

6
00:00:14,415 --> 00:00:15,530
Not on this level.

7
00:00:15,565 --> 00:00:17,352
You didn't have to
stick up for me in there.

8
00:00:17,353 --> 00:00:18,479
Don't do it again.

9
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,204
Evil Corp tapped you for CTO, yes?

10
00:00:22,238 --> 00:00:24,873
- You're ruining your life.
- I also ruined yours.

11
00:00:24,907 --> 00:00:27,709
Terry Colby was involved in the cover up

12
00:00:27,743 --> 00:00:31,028
of the Washington Township
toxic waste scandal.

13
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:34,816
Sharon, how do you not blow
your brains out, married to him?

14
00:00:34,817 --> 00:00:36,540
I'm in here.

15
00:00:38,454 --> 00:00:40,288
Do you mind sleeping here tonight?

16
00:00:40,623 --> 00:00:42,593
That girl in there is mine.

17
00:00:42,594 --> 00:00:44,759
If you're around tonight,
come over and tell me about it.

18
00:00:49,131 --> 00:00:50,466
Shayla?

19
00:00:50,467 --> 00:00:53,368
Sometimes
the universe aligns perfectly.

20
00:00:53,402 --> 00:00:55,270
Here I am, locked away,

21
00:00:55,304 --> 00:00:57,439
still it brings you right to me.

22
00:01:06,916 --> 00:01:08,650
I feel the sensation.

23
00:01:08,684 --> 00:01:09,885
Fight or flight.

24
00:01:09,919 --> 00:01:12,420
It's constant.

25
00:01:12,455 --> 00:01:14,422
I should just pick one.

26
00:01:14,457 --> 00:01:18,660
I, Elliot Alderson, am flight.

27
00:01:18,694 --> 00:01:19,961
I am fear.

28
00:01:19,996 --> 00:01:23,165
I am anxiety, terror, panic.

29
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:32,372
- Synced and corrected by skoad -
www.MY-SUBS.com

30
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:42,817
Doesn't feel real.

31
00:01:47,986 --> 00:01:52,194
- You should eat.
- Not hungry.

32
00:01:52,228 --> 00:01:54,946
I don't even know what I ordered.

33
00:01:57,233 --> 00:01:59,901
I'm sorry.

34
00:02:08,836 --> 00:02:13,235
- You don't like the guisado?
- No, it's good.

35
00:02:13,236 --> 00:02:14,583
Thank you.

36
00:02:26,984 --> 00:02:32,802
- What are you thinking about?
- First time we met.

37
00:02:35,037 --> 00:02:39,541
Doesn't feel that long ago.

38
00:02:39,575 --> 00:02:42,077
Now look at us.

39
00:02:42,111 --> 00:02:45,113
Who would have thought?

40
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:50,974
- If I could go back and undo this...
- You can't.

41
00:02:53,456 --> 00:02:55,991
You promised me.

42
00:02:56,025 --> 00:02:58,235
I'm gonna get you out of this, okay?

43
00:02:58,236 --> 00:02:59,861
Time's up.

44
00:02:59,895 --> 00:03:01,062
Let's go.

45
00:03:01,097 --> 00:03:02,063
Elliot!

46
00:03:03,198 --> 00:03:04,842
Sit down. Sit down.

47
00:03:12,474 --> 00:03:15,109
Come with me.

48
00:03:15,143 --> 00:03:19,146
Let's go.

49
00:03:47,476 --> 00:03:49,444
- Hello?
- The origin of your name.

50
00:03:49,478 --> 00:03:51,255
I looked it up for you, bruh.

51
00:03:51,256 --> 00:03:54,654
- Where are you taking her?
- Elliot.

52
00:03:54,655 --> 00:03:57,652
"Brave and true."

53
00:03:57,687 --> 00:04:01,718
Did you know the origin of
"brave" evolved from "savage?

54
00:04:01,719 --> 00:04:03,792
I don't know what you think this is about,

55
00:04:03,826 --> 00:04:05,460
but you need to let her go.

56
00:04:05,494 --> 00:04:06,961
You know, funny thing.

57
00:04:06,996 --> 00:04:08,997
My name means something similar.

58
00:04:09,031 --> 00:04:11,066
Brave traveler.

59
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:12,300
Adventurer.

60
00:04:12,335 --> 00:04:16,304
Savage traveler becomes brave traveler.

61
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:20,775
Are we savages, or are we brave?

62
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:22,110
Don't know, bro.

63
00:04:22,144 --> 00:04:25,814
Listen to me, man.

64
00:04:25,848 --> 00:04:29,584
When I found out you did
this, I didn't get angry.

65
00:04:29,618 --> 00:04:32,454
I got impressed.

66
00:04:32,488 --> 00:04:34,122
Your power.

67
00:04:34,156 --> 00:04:35,690
I want it, Elliot.

68
00:04:35,725 --> 00:04:38,026
And I want it so bad it makes my dick hard.

69
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:40,528
And I want it today.

70
00:04:40,563 --> 00:04:42,030
I don't know what you think I can do.

71
00:04:42,064 --> 00:04:44,532
I can't just hack you out of prison.

72
00:04:44,567 --> 00:04:47,635
Not all prisons are networked,
and even if yours is,

73
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:50,171
it would take weeks to find security holes.

74
00:04:50,206 --> 00:04:52,006
Has to be tonight.

75
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:53,975
I got crosshairs on my heart.

76
00:04:54,009 --> 00:04:55,643
I don't make it out,

77
00:04:55,678 --> 00:04:58,880
I'm dead, and that ain't
meant to be just yet.

78
00:04:58,914 --> 00:05:00,648
You do your thing, bro.

79
00:05:00,683 --> 00:05:03,017
You're asking the impossible.

80
00:05:03,052 --> 00:05:07,856
When we cross paths tonight,
Elliot, I'ma hug you.

81
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:09,891
Please listen, man.

82
00:05:09,925 --> 00:05:12,994
Shayla... this is on me.

83
00:05:12,995 --> 00:05:13,661
Okay?

84
00:05:13,696 --> 00:05:15,530
You got to let her go.

85
00:05:15,564 --> 00:05:16,831
Oh, that?

86
00:05:16,866 --> 00:05:18,466
She cool, bro.

87
00:05:18,501 --> 00:05:20,301
Trust me, she cool.

88
00:05:20,336 --> 00:05:22,337
She'll be there tonight too.

89
00:05:22,371 --> 00:05:24,546
It'll be one big happy happy.

90
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:30,044
Hey, Elliot.

91
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:31,913
I love you, bro.

92
00:05:52,712 --> 00:05:55,157
- Where's Shayla?
- Man, I'm not gonna tell you again.

93
00:05:55,158 --> 00:05:58,239
Stop asking so many questions.

94
00:05:58,274 --> 00:06:00,275
Come on.

95
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:06,581
Vera
may be out of his mind,

96
00:06:06,615 --> 00:06:10,218
but yes, it is possible to
hack into a prison's network.

97
00:06:10,252 --> 00:06:14,189
Most of them use regular
industrial control systems.

98
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:19,596
I'm a blind man to what
Vera sees in this dude.

99
00:06:19,597 --> 00:06:23,198
Amen. Techie computer hacker
genius, my thick Dominican dick.

100
00:06:25,601 --> 00:06:27,535
When
you have control of that,

101
00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:29,137
you basically have
control of the cell doors.

102
00:06:32,608 --> 00:06:35,477
But what these morons don't know is,

103
00:06:35,511 --> 00:06:38,980
it's almost impossible
without any research.

104
00:06:39,014 --> 00:06:42,383
Time to shine your cojones and get to work.

105
00:06:42,418 --> 00:06:45,820
Our only rule: do what we say.

106
00:06:45,855 --> 00:06:49,457
You violate that dictate,
we kill your sweetheart.

107
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:50,892
Yo, Isaac.

108
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:54,738
- How my dic-tate?
- Shut up, bitch.

109
00:06:55,698 --> 00:06:57,499
Dictate.

110
00:07:03,672 --> 00:07:06,007
Vera's bro, Isaac.

111
00:07:06,041 --> 00:07:08,176
Something about him bugs me,

112
00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:11,179
and you know what I like
to do when that happens?

113
00:07:23,025 --> 00:07:24,420
_

114
00:07:26,804 --> 00:07:30,091
_

115
00:07:36,072 --> 00:07:38,048
_

116
00:07:47,683 --> 00:07:52,120
Hi, I'm trying to reach Mr. Beckett.

117
00:07:52,154 --> 00:07:54,188
When would Mr. Lattimer be available?

118
00:07:54,223 --> 00:07:55,790
I can come in today.

119
00:07:55,824 --> 00:07:59,060
I already told you what
it's in reference to.

120
00:07:59,094 --> 00:08:02,130
I'm trying again for Mrs. Nayar.

121
00:08:02,164 --> 00:08:04,732
Regarding the Washington Township scandal.

122
00:08:04,767 --> 00:08:06,634
I may have found some information.

123
00:08:06,669 --> 00:08:09,237
Please don't put me on hold again.

124
00:08:23,285 --> 00:08:26,353
Happy Monday, Angela.

125
00:08:26,388 --> 00:08:28,856
How fun.

126
00:08:30,183 --> 00:08:33,194
- Thanks.
- Mm-hmm.

127
00:09:13,068 --> 00:09:15,803
I'm Emily Moss's daughter.

128
00:09:15,838 --> 00:09:17,339
Angela Moss.

129
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:19,474
- I called...
- Six times.

130
00:09:19,508 --> 00:09:21,042
Yes.

131
00:09:21,076 --> 00:09:25,079
I'm here to discuss the
Washington Township case.

132
00:09:27,449 --> 00:09:30,752
I'm listening.

133
00:09:30,786 --> 00:09:32,720
You represented the victim's families.

134
00:09:32,755 --> 00:09:35,156
26 families, mine included.

135
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:37,558
I thought with the latest
news in the data dumps...

136
00:09:37,593 --> 00:09:39,260
the Terry Colby scandal,

137
00:09:39,294 --> 00:09:41,129
his covering up the chemical waste spill.

138
00:09:41,163 --> 00:09:42,930
Alleged.

139
00:09:42,965 --> 00:09:46,934
- Well, and documents.
- Superficial.

140
00:09:46,969 --> 00:09:51,172
But if we bring this
stronger, more concrete case...

141
00:09:51,206 --> 00:09:54,142
you'll see that I have the
evidence from the data dumps.

142
00:09:54,176 --> 00:09:57,445
- Along with further research.
- Stickies.

143
00:09:57,479 --> 00:10:00,181
Oh, and you've highlighted and underlined.

144
00:10:00,215 --> 00:10:03,217
This is serious.

145
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:09,824
So, you want to take Internet
gossip to federal court

146
00:10:09,858 --> 00:10:12,193
and throw it at the strongest conglomerate

147
00:10:12,227 --> 00:10:14,362
in the history of civilization?

148
00:10:26,875 --> 00:10:29,510
Guy in the suit.

149
00:10:29,545 --> 00:10:31,779
Twice convicted of sexual assault,

150
00:10:31,814 --> 00:10:33,815
charged again this past weekend.

151
00:10:33,849 --> 00:10:35,450
Raped his pregnant girlfriend.

152
00:10:35,484 --> 00:10:37,485
Bashed her head in with an Xbox.

153
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:40,188
Claims she cheated during Halo.

154
00:10:40,222 --> 00:10:43,224
Yet I have a better
chance of defending him.

155
00:10:56,004 --> 00:10:58,706
You called back.

156
00:10:58,741 --> 00:11:00,742
I called every lawyer from this case,

157
00:11:00,776 --> 00:11:03,778
and you're the only
one that called me back.

158
00:11:39,914 --> 00:11:41,110
_

159
00:11:42,548 --> 00:11:46,800
_

160
00:12:00,487 --> 00:12:04,158
Shit. Shit, shit.

161
00:12:08,463 --> 00:12:10,164
Connection
closed by remote host.

162
00:12:10,198 --> 00:12:13,400
But we had a fish. I was in.

163
00:12:13,435 --> 00:12:17,071
The exploit started to run,
and then... was it the code?

164
00:12:17,105 --> 00:12:19,740
Brah, what's the deal?

165
00:12:26,014 --> 00:12:27,681
I got to take her for a walk.

166
00:12:27,716 --> 00:12:29,516
Why?

167
00:12:29,551 --> 00:12:31,013
'Cause she'll piss on the floor if I don't.

168
00:12:31,014 --> 00:12:34,288
You think I've a shit
about your goddamn floor?

169
00:12:41,696 --> 00:12:43,497
I'm just playing, brah.

170
00:12:43,531 --> 00:12:48,102
Yeah, you can take her.

171
00:12:48,136 --> 00:12:49,536
You hear what I said?

172
00:12:49,571 --> 00:12:53,006
I said you can take her.

173
00:13:01,816 --> 00:13:04,218
Come on.

174
00:13:14,896 --> 00:13:19,366
- It's out.
- Okay, got you.

175
00:13:39,187 --> 00:13:42,222
Did she like my little toy?

176
00:13:42,257 --> 00:13:46,727
- Did you write that exploit yourself?
- I had an hour.

177
00:13:46,761 --> 00:13:49,363
So what, you just pulled code
from Rapid Nine or some shit?

178
00:13:49,397 --> 00:13:52,199
Since when did you become a script kiddie?

179
00:13:52,233 --> 00:13:55,068
I repeat, I had an hour.

180
00:13:55,103 --> 00:13:57,905
Malware detection must have caught it.

181
00:13:57,939 --> 00:14:01,008
- You fucked me.
- Hey, don't put this on me, okay?

182
00:14:01,042 --> 00:14:02,409
This is a shit show

183
00:14:02,444 --> 00:14:04,378
and you gave me no time to do it right.

184
00:14:04,412 --> 00:14:07,381
I can run circles around an
ICS given the proper whitepapers

185
00:14:07,415 --> 00:14:10,184
and time.

186
00:14:10,218 --> 00:14:13,169
- Where the hell are you going?
- I have no problem telling

187
00:14:13,170 --> 00:14:15,184
these two douchetools they're
gonna have to sit on their pricks

188
00:14:15,185 --> 00:14:16,924
till we can find a better solution.

189
00:14:16,958 --> 00:14:19,388
- You don't understand. These guys are...
- Assholes?

190
00:14:19,389 --> 00:14:22,429
Yeah, I'm gonna tell them what's up.

191
00:14:24,933 --> 00:14:26,366
That's what's up, girl.

192
00:14:26,401 --> 00:14:27,434
Hmm?

193
00:14:27,469 --> 00:14:29,236
Now, let's go.

194
00:14:39,614 --> 00:14:43,050
So none of those guys called
you back, not even Lattimer?

195
00:14:43,084 --> 00:14:44,785
Pussies.

196
00:14:44,819 --> 00:14:46,587
I bet they didn't even
bother to read the data dumps.

197
00:14:46,621 --> 00:14:49,156
But you read them.

198
00:14:49,190 --> 00:14:51,058
You know it took me eight years

199
00:14:51,092 --> 00:14:54,728
to rebuild my career after
our case was dismissed?

200
00:14:54,762 --> 00:15:00,300
So, as much as I think this
company is evil incarnate...

201
00:15:00,335 --> 00:15:02,603
and trust me, they are...

202
00:15:02,637 --> 00:15:04,938
You know, it's not worth it.

203
00:15:09,544 --> 00:15:12,112
What would it take,

204
00:15:12,146 --> 00:15:15,048
hypothetically...

205
00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:20,153
- What do we need to prove our case?
- Hypothetically, a reliable eye witness...

206
00:15:20,155 --> 00:15:23,209
You know, if you miraculously
find someone on the inside to flip.

207
00:15:23,658 --> 00:15:25,573
Someone who was there

208
00:15:25,574 --> 00:15:30,664
when the decision was made to
falsify chemical waste intel...

209
00:15:30,698 --> 00:15:32,050
So,

210
00:15:32,051 --> 00:15:36,503
unless you're Facebook friends
with one of those assholes,

211
00:15:36,538 --> 00:15:40,073
this hypothetical is just that.

212
00:15:42,377 --> 00:15:44,278
Let's move on.

213
00:15:44,312 --> 00:15:47,014
Where are you working these days?

214
00:15:47,048 --> 00:15:48,682
You have a boyfriend?

215
00:15:48,716 --> 00:15:51,552
How's your dad?

216
00:15:51,586 --> 00:15:55,055
I work for a company
that doesn't respect me,

217
00:15:55,089 --> 00:15:57,824
my boyfriend recently cheated on me,

218
00:15:57,859 --> 00:16:02,262
and my father is drowning in debt.

219
00:16:09,050 --> 00:16:11,952
- I'll see you next time.
- Okay.

220
00:16:18,025 --> 00:16:21,227
Fluorescent lights are hell, no?

221
00:16:23,230 --> 00:16:25,064
Was there a change in schedule?

222
00:16:25,099 --> 00:16:28,034
I thought I had Spencer next.

223
00:16:28,068 --> 00:16:32,022
These interviews, they're
just a waste of your time.

224
00:16:32,023 --> 00:16:35,875
I mean, you know our regulatory
and IP issues inside out.

225
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:38,302
I was thinking we play
hooky the rest of the day,

226
00:16:38,303 --> 00:16:42,822
hit the back nine.

227
00:16:43,869 --> 00:16:47,974
- Is that a Vacheron?
- Patek Philippe Tourbillon.

228
00:16:47,975 --> 00:16:52,158
A gift from the Prince of, uh...

229
00:16:55,129 --> 00:17:00,459
Oh, does it even matter?

230
00:17:03,103 --> 00:17:06,606
But I'm not blowing off
my remaining interviews.

231
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:09,408
Look.

232
00:17:09,743 --> 00:17:13,746
I know you think you
were a shoo-in for CTO,

233
00:17:13,747 --> 00:17:16,549
and you're pissed.

234
00:17:16,583 --> 00:17:20,753
Probably wishing I'd fall
into the subway tracks.

235
00:17:20,788 --> 00:17:25,458
So how about you cut the bullshit?

236
00:17:25,492 --> 00:17:28,594
I'm afraid your paranoia has
gotten the best of you, but,

237
00:17:28,629 --> 00:17:30,653
nevertheless, please excuse me.

238
00:17:30,654 --> 00:17:32,065
I'll leave you to review your notes

239
00:17:32,066 --> 00:17:33,553
before Spencer arrives.

240
00:17:33,554 --> 00:17:37,938
Oh, and thank you for dinner.

241
00:17:37,972 --> 00:17:39,306
The entire evening was enchanting.

242
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:43,048
The food, the wine, the lovely Sharon.

243
00:17:44,378 --> 00:17:49,206
Please tell her I say hello.

244
00:17:49,772 --> 00:17:52,006
Did you enjoy the view?

245
00:17:56,211 --> 00:17:58,719
What?

246
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:05,549
- Do you think she wouldn't tell me?
- I'm not sure what you're trying...

247
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:07,722
You want to watch me piss too?

248
00:18:07,756 --> 00:18:10,713
- I've had several glasses of water.
- Scott, a misunderstand...

249
00:18:10,714 --> 00:18:14,028
Happy to pull my dick out
for you, if that's your thing.

250
00:18:14,063 --> 00:18:16,325
Watching the Knowles family urinate.

251
00:18:16,326 --> 00:18:21,235
Hell, I could fly my brother in from Miami.

252
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:23,738
He has the bladder of a small child.

253
00:18:23,772 --> 00:18:26,184
You'd probably bust a nut
watching him take a leak.

254
00:18:26,653 --> 00:18:29,276
I'm not sure what she told
you, but if I were you,

255
00:18:29,277 --> 00:18:31,512
I would tell her to find
more appropriate ways

256
00:18:31,547 --> 00:18:34,716
of managing her imagination.

257
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:36,517
Tyrell.

258
00:18:36,552 --> 00:18:38,086
I want you to accept a hard truth,

259
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:41,923
right here, right now, in front of me.

260
00:18:41,957 --> 00:18:45,960
You are not going to be CTO.

261
00:18:48,364 --> 00:18:52,600
I want to see that look
wash over your face.

262
00:18:52,634 --> 00:18:56,437
It's the only way I know
you'll stop playing these

263
00:18:56,472 --> 00:19:00,648
silly, silly games.

264
00:19:00,649 --> 00:19:05,046
Oh, I am fully aware you're CTO, Scott.

265
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:10,084
I'm not sure what more I can offer you.

266
00:19:10,119 --> 00:19:12,754
Wait.

267
00:19:12,788 --> 00:19:15,189
Here.

268
00:19:16,925 --> 00:19:18,292
I feel bad.

269
00:19:18,327 --> 00:19:20,628
After all, you got a child on the way.

270
00:19:20,662 --> 00:19:21,829
You need all the help you can get.

271
00:19:21,864 --> 00:19:23,331
In fact,

272
00:19:23,332 --> 00:19:26,968
this would probably pay off
the rest of your mortgage.

273
00:19:27,002 --> 00:19:32,006
Aren't you still in that neat
little two bedroom in Chelsea?

274
00:19:35,177 --> 00:19:37,612
There.

275
00:19:40,482 --> 00:19:43,484
That's the look I was looking for.

276
00:19:52,595 --> 00:19:57,565
I keep brute force
thinking, but it's not working.

277
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:58,967
I need help.

278
00:20:12,781 --> 00:20:16,251
- Elliot, you in there?
- Shit.

279
00:20:16,285 --> 00:20:17,852
Why is she here?

280
00:20:19,455 --> 00:20:20,588
Elliot!

281
00:20:23,192 --> 00:20:25,162
Let me in.

282
00:20:27,196 --> 00:20:31,099
Elliot, you in there?

283
00:20:31,133 --> 00:20:32,834
Little blonde bitty.

284
00:20:32,868 --> 00:20:35,642
Elliot, hit the buzzer.

285
00:20:37,678 --> 00:20:38,812
I know you're in there.

286
00:20:38,846 --> 00:20:40,347
Go.

287
00:20:40,381 --> 00:20:42,382
Shut her up, and get
her the hell out of here.

288
00:20:42,416 --> 00:20:45,652
Elliot. Buzzer. Now.

289
00:20:45,686 --> 00:20:48,586
- What about Darlene?
- She stays with us.

290
00:20:48,587 --> 00:20:50,056
And we'll be watching you,

291
00:20:50,091 --> 00:20:52,859
so don't bother trying any
dumb shit, you dumb shit.

292
00:20:57,532 --> 00:20:59,699
Fuck!

293
00:21:11,912 --> 00:21:15,481
Do you understand why you're angry?

294
00:21:15,516 --> 00:21:19,268
- 'Cause you know I'm right.
-

295
00:21:20,550 --> 00:21:26,536
- _
- _

296
00:21:29,229 --> 00:21:31,843
_

297
00:21:38,606 --> 00:21:41,163
_

298
00:21:42,034 --> 00:21:44,001
_

299
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:46,733
_

300
00:21:47,004 --> 00:21:48,325
_

301
00:21:52,741 --> 00:21:58,264
_

302
00:21:59,247 --> 00:22:02,668
_

303
00:22:02,907 --> 00:22:05,473
_

304
00:22:06,497 --> 00:22:10,635
- _
- _

305
00:22:12,527 --> 00:22:18,042
- _
- _

306
00:22:27,344 --> 00:22:30,512
- Hey.
- Hey.

307
00:22:30,547 --> 00:22:33,148
I tried looking for you after
Gideon's the other night.

308
00:22:33,183 --> 00:22:38,463
- Where were you?
- I had to think about things, you know?

309
00:22:40,357 --> 00:22:44,727
We always knew what Evil Corp did.

310
00:22:44,761 --> 00:22:47,162
We didn't have the proof,

311
00:22:47,197 --> 00:22:50,666
but we knew.

312
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:52,401
We were right about it all along.

313
00:22:52,435 --> 00:22:56,004
In fact, that news report
wasn't a confirmation.

314
00:22:56,039 --> 00:23:00,075
It was a reminder of how angry I am.

315
00:23:04,447 --> 00:23:09,051
You remember Nayar, the lawyer on the case?

316
00:23:09,085 --> 00:23:12,654
- I went to her, Elliot.
- Listen, Angela, now's not...

317
00:23:12,689 --> 00:23:17,659
I have an idea that will change the world.

318
00:23:17,694 --> 00:23:19,483
I know it sounds really stupid,

319
00:23:19,484 --> 00:23:23,866
but I know how to do it.

320
00:23:25,435 --> 00:23:30,406
I think it could actually work.

321
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:33,291
- I can't tell you what it is, because...
- Evil Corp, Angela,

322
00:23:33,292 --> 00:23:35,844
Vera, his brother, Darlene, Shayla.

323
00:23:35,879 --> 00:23:37,613
This is too much.

324
00:23:37,647 --> 00:23:40,516
I should just tell her
what she wants to hear.

325
00:23:40,550 --> 00:23:42,551
Angela,

326
00:23:42,585 --> 00:23:45,521
trust yourself.

327
00:23:45,555 --> 00:23:47,723
You'll do what's right.

328
00:23:55,665 --> 00:23:59,034
That's all I needed.

329
00:23:59,068 --> 00:24:03,560
- How's Shayla, by the way?
- She's...

330
00:24:05,618 --> 00:24:10,636
- you know.
- Tell her I say hi.

331
00:24:22,525 --> 00:24:23,892
You have no time to pull off

332
00:24:23,927 --> 00:24:26,354
- whatever it is you think you're doing.
- What are you doing here?

333
00:24:26,355 --> 00:24:27,948
- How did you know?
- Darlene.

334
00:24:27,949 --> 00:24:29,414
These guys aren't playing around.

335
00:24:29,415 --> 00:24:30,417
They will fucking kill you.

336
00:24:30,418 --> 00:24:34,302
- Now wise up, and let's go.
- Darlene's in there. We can't leave.

337
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:39,408
Okay, then we call the cops.

338
00:24:39,442 --> 00:24:40,576
There's no other choice here.

339
00:24:40,610 --> 00:24:43,278
- It's the only way out of this.
- I can't call the cops.

340
00:24:43,313 --> 00:24:45,494
- Shayla will die.
- Oh, come on.

341
00:24:45,495 --> 00:24:47,583
She knew exactly what she
was getting herself into.

342
00:24:47,617 --> 00:24:49,585
You think his employees
have a long life expectancy?

343
00:24:49,619 --> 00:24:50,953
She was dead the minute

344
00:24:50,987 --> 00:24:54,051
- she started working with that maniac.
- Forget it. It's not happening.

345
00:24:54,958 --> 00:24:56,825
This is a zero-sum game.

346
00:24:56,860 --> 00:24:58,861
Calculate all the outcomes.

347
00:24:58,895 --> 00:25:00,829
If you don't pull off
this ridiculous miracle...

348
00:25:00,864 --> 00:25:03,298
and odds are, you won't...
you die, and so does Shayla.

349
00:25:03,333 --> 00:25:04,500
That much we know.

350
00:25:04,534 --> 00:25:06,034
But assume for a second

351
00:25:06,069 --> 00:25:07,936
that you do pull this off,
bust Vera out of prison.

352
00:25:07,971 --> 00:25:10,606
Who's to say he doesn't
kill you, Shayla, Darlene?

353
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,975
It would be in his own
best interest to do that.

354
00:25:13,009 --> 00:25:15,010
Either way, you all end up dead.

355
00:25:15,044 --> 00:25:17,179
It's the only way Vera wins.

356
00:25:17,213 --> 00:25:18,814
Zero-sum, Elliot.

357
00:25:18,848 --> 00:25:20,449
You're playing a game you already lost.

358
00:25:20,483 --> 00:25:24,853
- You know I'm right.
- There's got to be a way.

359
00:25:24,888 --> 00:25:29,558
- I can think of a way.
- I get it, kiddo.

360
00:25:29,592 --> 00:25:32,394
You want to help people. Watch over 'em.

361
00:25:32,428 --> 00:25:34,897
The best thing you
can do for Shayla...

362
00:25:34,931 --> 00:25:39,813
- allow her to become a memory.
- No.

363
00:25:41,905 --> 00:25:46,375
True courage is about
being honest with yourself.

364
00:25:46,409 --> 00:25:49,344
Especially when it's difficult.

365
00:25:49,379 --> 00:25:55,217
There is no plan where
both you and Shayla survive.

366
00:25:55,251 --> 00:25:57,219
I can think of a way.

367
00:25:57,253 --> 00:26:01,390
This new world that we are so
close to creating will never be.

368
00:26:01,424 --> 00:26:03,058
And that new world, that is success.

369
00:26:03,092 --> 00:26:05,594
fsociety is success.

370
00:26:05,628 --> 00:26:07,329
Look at what you accomplished
at Steel Mountain.

371
00:26:07,363 --> 00:26:10,032
- That got us nowhere.
- You took them down.

372
00:26:10,066 --> 00:26:12,167
You won that battle.

373
00:26:12,201 --> 00:26:15,604
This... this is failure.

374
00:26:15,638 --> 00:26:17,839
This is the old Elliot.

375
00:26:17,874 --> 00:26:21,276
The one who turns to morphine,
to drugs when he feels weak.

376
00:26:21,311 --> 00:26:23,545
A coward who can't face the truth,

377
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:28,417
even though it's staring
him right in the face.

378
00:26:28,451 --> 00:26:30,419
There's
that sensation again.

379
00:26:30,453 --> 00:26:32,220
Fight or flight.

380
00:26:32,255 --> 00:26:35,457
Three lives at stake, including my own.

381
00:26:35,491 --> 00:26:40,095
I, Elliot Alderson, am...

382
00:26:40,129 --> 00:26:41,597
what?

383
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:48,403
Tom Petty, Pink Floyd,
Van Halen? What's up, man?

384
00:26:48,438 --> 00:26:50,872
You ain't got no Drake,
no Pitbull, no nothing?

385
00:26:50,907 --> 00:26:52,774
Like, what's up? What the fuck?

386
00:26:56,179 --> 00:27:00,945
- What's up, Rain Man?
- I'm ready to bust Vera out.

387
00:27:01,250 --> 00:27:03,151
I can get into the network.

388
00:27:03,186 --> 00:27:04,720
We need to go to the jail.

389
00:27:04,754 --> 00:27:07,389
Now.

390
00:27:07,423 --> 00:27:10,158
- She stays here.
- No, I'm not leaving you.

391
00:27:10,193 --> 00:27:11,660
Don't worry,

392
00:27:11,694 --> 00:27:14,846
he's in no position to
be giving out orders.

393
00:27:16,633 --> 00:27:20,168
Let's go, girl.

394
00:27:20,203 --> 00:27:23,805
Remember when the
panic would set in and we had a solution?

395
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:26,074
To be honest, I miss that.

396
00:27:26,109 --> 00:27:31,013
Life is so much easier when you're numb.

397
00:27:31,047 --> 00:27:37,474
- What's the plan, bitch boy?
- First Shayla, now Darlene.

398
00:27:38,521 --> 00:27:41,594
- Yo, what the fuck?
- Elliot, what are you doing?

399
00:27:43,026 --> 00:27:45,460
Like a hard
drive blasted by excessive voltage,

400
00:27:45,495 --> 00:27:46,528
my mind is frayed.

401
00:27:46,562 --> 00:27:48,597
Close to fried.

402
00:27:48,631 --> 00:27:51,366
I can feel the static
running through my brain.

403
00:27:51,401 --> 00:27:54,002
Serotonin receptors working overtime.

404
00:27:54,037 --> 00:27:55,871
I need more time.

405
00:27:59,509 --> 00:28:04,680
- Tonight, tonight, tonight.
- More time right now.

406
00:28:04,714 --> 00:28:06,648
I'm working on our project as we speak,

407
00:28:06,683 --> 00:28:09,985
so it's in your best interest
to keep talking with me.

408
00:28:10,019 --> 00:28:11,853
At the
security desk, my cell phone

409
00:28:11,888 --> 00:28:14,356
is running an undetectable
activated signal sniffer

410
00:28:14,390 --> 00:28:17,859
that will locate any kind
of wireless signal in sight.

411
00:28:17,894 --> 00:28:20,128
By the time I leave this building,

412
00:28:20,163 --> 00:28:23,131
I'll own its network.

413
00:28:23,166 --> 00:28:25,133
Good on you.

414
00:28:25,168 --> 00:28:30,505
Brave, but stupid.

415
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:34,576
You showed your face, and
then I skip out tonight.

416
00:28:34,610 --> 00:28:37,679
- Who do you think they're gonna finger?
- I'm opening every cell.

417
00:28:37,714 --> 00:28:39,915
That way, they can't
trace it back to you or me.

418
00:28:43,352 --> 00:28:44,319
Yeah, bro.

419
00:28:45,955 --> 00:28:48,090
That's what I'm talking about.

420
00:28:48,124 --> 00:28:49,191
Whoo!

421
00:28:50,359 --> 00:28:52,327
I told you, didn't I?

422
00:28:52,361 --> 00:28:56,665
- The universe got big plans for us, bro.
- Sit back down.

423
00:29:06,576 --> 00:29:09,044
When you get out, I realize
you're gonna have to split.

424
00:29:09,078 --> 00:29:12,581
You won't be able to stay
in the tri-state area.

425
00:29:12,615 --> 00:29:13,915
Oh, I love this.

426
00:29:13,950 --> 00:29:15,784
Go on.

427
00:29:15,818 --> 00:29:18,787
Wherever you go, you're gonna
need funding to keep surviving.

428
00:29:18,821 --> 00:29:20,388
Which means your whole operation still

429
00:29:20,423 --> 00:29:22,057
needs to be making you money.

430
00:29:22,091 --> 00:29:26,142
- Come on, Elliot. Give it to me.
- I hacked Isaac's phone.

431
00:29:28,731 --> 00:29:32,476
He had everything. Your crew,
shipments, the entire operation.

432
00:29:32,477 --> 00:29:35,704
I took it all. I own your whole world.

433
00:29:41,611 --> 00:29:43,044
I need your word.

434
00:29:43,079 --> 00:29:46,248
When this goes down, Shayla and I go free.

435
00:29:46,282 --> 00:29:47,649
You leave us alone.

436
00:29:47,683 --> 00:29:49,384
Forever.

437
00:29:49,418 --> 00:29:51,153
If anyone tries to hurt us,

438
00:29:51,187 --> 00:29:56,591
if I even see one of your guys
following me, I leak everything.

439
00:29:56,626 --> 00:30:00,044
- You're saying this knowing...
- You can kill me anytime, yes.

440
00:30:01,130 --> 00:30:03,932
That's why I coded the leak
to auto-send every 24 hours

441
00:30:03,966 --> 00:30:06,735
unless I continuously disable it.

442
00:30:06,769 --> 00:30:08,770
No one else has access.

443
00:30:08,805 --> 00:30:11,840
If anything happens to me or Shayla,

444
00:30:11,874 --> 00:30:15,076
your money gets deleted.

445
00:30:19,215 --> 00:30:20,849
Guns up, Vera, let's go.

446
00:30:27,690 --> 00:30:29,991
Remember.

447
00:30:30,026 --> 00:30:32,294
I'ma hug you.

448
00:30:57,966 --> 00:31:03,692
- So what's your deal?
- I'm here to see Terry Colby.

449
00:31:08,376 --> 00:31:12,346
Who is that, another damn reporter?

450
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:14,315
No comment. Do you understand?

451
00:31:19,054 --> 00:31:20,888
Do I know you?

452
00:31:27,262 --> 00:31:28,596
Get the hell away from my home.

453
00:31:28,630 --> 00:31:30,598
Get away from my home.

454
00:31:37,939 --> 00:31:39,440
WPA2 Wi-Fi?

455
00:31:39,474 --> 00:31:40,441
Shit.

456
00:31:40,475 --> 00:31:42,276
Borderline unhackable.

457
00:31:42,310 --> 00:31:44,812
Getting that handshake could take days.

458
00:31:44,846 --> 00:31:47,114
The noose is tightening.

459
00:32:06,768 --> 00:32:09,303
The mobile feed on the cameras.

460
00:32:09,337 --> 00:32:13,107
I don't need to hack WPA2
when there's dedicated 4G.

461
00:32:16,684 --> 00:32:19,023
_

462
00:32:26,288 --> 00:32:29,809
We're good. I can pull this off.

463
00:32:31,893 --> 00:32:33,027
- Get in.
- Let's go, girl.

464
00:32:33,061 --> 00:32:36,096
Nah, just him.

465
00:32:36,131 --> 00:32:38,365
- Yo, Isaac, what you doing...
- Nah, bro, it's fine.

466
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:40,935
I just want to have a
private chat with him.

467
00:32:40,969 --> 00:32:42,703
Come on, it's cool.

468
00:32:42,737 --> 00:32:44,271
We don't have any time, man.

469
00:32:44,306 --> 00:32:48,108
- I got to get to work.
- Get the fuck in the car.

470
00:32:55,650 --> 00:32:57,651
- Yo man, where you going, what you doing?
- All good, all good.

471
00:32:57,652 --> 00:32:58,652
- Just gonna have a talk.
- Are you doing?

472
00:33:13,535 --> 00:33:14,902
Why are you doing this?

473
00:33:14,936 --> 00:33:15,903
I can free your brother.

474
00:33:15,937 --> 00:33:19,073
- I figured it out.
- It just wasn't your day, bruh.

475
00:33:19,107 --> 00:33:20,730
I hacked your whole operation.

476
00:33:20,731 --> 00:33:22,424
- If you kill me...
- You don't get it.

477
00:33:22,425 --> 00:33:26,013
Like I said, it just wasn't your day.

478
00:33:28,883 --> 00:33:30,718
Stop.

479
00:33:36,858 --> 00:33:38,325
I suppose
a bullet through the brain

480
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:40,427
is peaceful in its own right.

481
00:33:47,736 --> 00:33:52,539
You don't want me to free Vera.

482
00:33:52,574 --> 00:33:54,708
That's why you don't
care about the operation.

483
00:33:54,743 --> 00:33:58,653
- I'd pick better last words.
- You're trying to kill him.

484
00:33:58,654 --> 00:34:01,682
That's why Vera wants to leave tonight.

485
00:34:01,716 --> 00:34:03,917
That's what's been bugging me about you.

486
00:34:03,952 --> 00:34:06,287
You never wanted me to break him out.

487
00:34:06,321 --> 00:34:08,789
Your best option for survival
is to kill him in prison,

488
00:34:08,823 --> 00:34:09,923
because if you don't,

489
00:34:09,958 --> 00:34:12,593
you're dead.

490
00:34:12,627 --> 00:34:14,461
You're the reason Vera's
locked up right now,

491
00:34:14,496 --> 00:34:16,964
and he knows it.

492
00:34:16,998 --> 00:34:18,799
Doesn't matter anyway.

493
00:34:18,833 --> 00:34:23,037
Vera was just gloating about how
he got in with the right crew,

494
00:34:23,071 --> 00:34:26,307
how he got the jump on some men.

495
00:34:26,341 --> 00:34:27,608
He's not worried, man.

496
00:34:27,642 --> 00:34:30,413
- He's protected now.
- Bullshit.

497
00:34:30,414 --> 00:34:32,601
That leaves
you with a zero-sum game.

498
00:34:32,602 --> 00:34:33,925
If you don't get him out of jail,

499
00:34:33,926 --> 00:34:36,016
he'll have you killed for failing.

500
00:34:36,050 --> 00:34:37,718
Only way this works in your favor

501
00:34:37,752 --> 00:34:40,254
is for you to kill him first,

502
00:34:40,288 --> 00:34:42,523
and you can't do that
with him inside anymore.

503
00:34:42,557 --> 00:34:44,024
Shut up, motherfucker.

504
00:34:44,058 --> 00:34:48,446
- Shut the fuck up.
- Let me free him.

505
00:34:50,598 --> 00:34:53,233
When I break Vera out tonight,

506
00:34:53,268 --> 00:34:56,036
you do with your brother what you want.

507
00:34:56,070 --> 00:34:57,504
That's the only outcome

508
00:34:57,539 --> 00:35:01,375
where you got the possibility of living.

509
00:35:02,777 --> 00:35:05,512
It's your best move.

510
00:35:05,547 --> 00:35:08,582
What makes you think I still
won't kill you afterwards?

511
00:35:12,654 --> 00:35:15,355
I don't.

512
00:35:15,390 --> 00:35:17,918
I'm just playing my best move.

513
00:35:44,773 --> 00:35:47,003
I need 30 to 40
seconds with the patrol car's

514
00:35:47,004 --> 00:35:50,812
Bluetooth connection to
run the exploit on the PLC.

515
00:35:50,813 --> 00:35:55,950
- And then?
- The plan executes at 9:49.

516
00:35:55,984 --> 00:35:57,685
All the cell doors should open.

517
00:35:59,354 --> 00:36:02,924
Hey, I wanted to ask you about something.

518
00:36:02,958 --> 00:36:05,593
- Oh, yeah, what's that?
- You.

519
00:36:31,420 --> 00:36:32,820
Give me a call.

520
00:36:32,855 --> 00:36:37,391
- We'll grab a drink, talk, whatever.
- All right.

521
00:36:43,765 --> 00:36:46,767
The exploit's on his laptop.

522
00:36:52,374 --> 00:36:55,343
Now I need to force-feed
it into the jail's network.

523
00:36:55,418 --> 00:37:00,211
_

524
00:37:00,212 --> 00:37:01,983
- I like what I hear.
- _

525
00:37:02,017 --> 00:37:04,485
_

526
00:37:07,089 --> 00:37:10,558
- I paused the exploit.
- Drive.

527
00:37:10,592 --> 00:37:12,860
Darlene's no longer part of the plan.

528
00:37:12,895 --> 00:37:15,897
We got an alarm
going off, east-side exit.

529
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:21,936
- What in the hell?
- Tell you what.

530
00:37:21,970 --> 00:37:24,071
We go out, we drink, we dance,

531
00:37:24,106 --> 00:37:25,673
see where the night takes us.

532
00:37:25,707 --> 00:37:26,698
You sure you want to make

533
00:37:26,699 --> 00:37:30,002
- that choice right now?
- I only need to press one key

534
00:37:30,003 --> 00:37:33,280
to run the exploit. Or, I can press
another and disable the entire plan.

535
00:37:33,281 --> 00:37:36,317
I made my move.

536
00:37:38,954 --> 00:37:40,555
You make yours.

537
00:37:47,396 --> 00:37:49,063
Shit.

538
00:37:49,097 --> 00:37:50,565
Please move back, miss.

539
00:37:50,599 --> 00:37:53,134
- I got to get back ASAP.
- Whatever.

540
00:38:01,176 --> 00:38:05,680
Look, I got to come back now.
My computer's on the fritz.

541
00:38:07,349 --> 00:38:09,450
Let's go to the meet, DJ.

542
00:38:09,484 --> 00:38:12,420
If I mis-typed
one command, hit one wrong key,

543
00:38:12,454 --> 00:38:14,422
the cell doors won't open.

544
00:38:14,456 --> 00:38:16,824
And we both know what that means.

545
00:38:16,858 --> 00:38:18,826
Did I make a mistake?

546
00:38:18,860 --> 00:38:21,862
No, I don't make mistakes.

547
00:38:26,301 --> 00:38:28,669
One minute till Vera.

548
00:38:28,704 --> 00:38:31,439
For all his insane, inhumane ideas,

549
00:38:31,473 --> 00:38:34,141
he does understand the world.

550
00:38:34,176 --> 00:38:36,911
The wild savagery of the world.

551
00:38:43,979 --> 00:38:46,998
- What you need your piece for, bro?
- Boy Wonder says

552
00:38:46,999 --> 00:38:50,246
he's opening all the cells.
If some fool tries to rush us,

553
00:38:51,912 --> 00:38:53,646
I want to be ready.

554
00:39:11,765 --> 00:39:15,489
- Hey, what the shit?
- Power surge caused by all the cell doors

555
00:39:15,490 --> 00:39:17,003
opening at the same time.

556
00:39:17,037 --> 00:39:20,048
- What about security? Sirens?
- The jail's network will show

557
00:39:20,049 --> 00:39:23,849
all cells locked and closed.
Alarms are silent for two minutes.

558
00:40:02,316 --> 00:40:04,717
Yes. Yes.

559
00:40:04,752 --> 00:40:06,552
This shit right here,

560
00:40:06,587 --> 00:40:10,590
this shit tastes better
than any pussy I ever had.

561
00:40:10,624 --> 00:40:14,594
Whoo!

562
00:40:26,507 --> 00:40:28,374
DJ, shoot the cocksucker.

563
00:40:43,190 --> 00:40:46,292
My own brother.

564
00:40:46,327 --> 00:40:50,029
That's what the universe asked of me.

565
00:40:50,064 --> 00:40:53,199
To be my brother's keeper.

566
00:40:53,233 --> 00:40:55,034
Like Cain after Abel,

567
00:40:55,069 --> 00:40:59,038
I'll be a fugitive and
wanderer on the earth.

568
00:40:59,273 --> 00:41:03,409
Brave fugitive.

569
00:41:03,443 --> 00:41:06,512
Brave wanderer.

570
00:41:06,547 --> 00:41:09,382
Look how you helped me.

571
00:41:09,416 --> 00:41:12,351
That's the kind of bravery
I've been talking about.

572
00:41:12,386 --> 00:41:15,821
But now...

573
00:41:15,856 --> 00:41:19,559
now I want you to look at Isaac.

574
00:41:19,593 --> 00:41:22,094
Look.

575
00:41:28,435 --> 00:41:29,669
Dead proof.

576
00:41:29,703 --> 00:41:31,737
My operation is over.

577
00:41:31,772 --> 00:41:33,439
So go on, crash it.

578
00:41:33,473 --> 00:41:35,107
Burn it to the ground.

579
00:41:35,142 --> 00:41:37,276
Doesn't matter.

580
00:41:37,311 --> 00:41:40,846
I'm gone.

581
00:41:40,881 --> 00:41:42,615
A spirit.

582
00:41:42,649 --> 00:41:45,618
One with all the heavens.

583
00:41:45,652 --> 00:41:47,453
All existence.

584
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:55,062
Shayla.

585
00:41:55,096 --> 00:42:00,967
- Where is she?
- Keys, yo.

586
00:42:01,002 --> 00:42:04,971
Told you you'd get her back, bro.

587
00:42:05,006 --> 00:42:09,676
You just didn't realize she
was with you the whole time.

588
