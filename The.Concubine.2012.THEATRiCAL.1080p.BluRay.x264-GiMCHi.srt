A KIM DAE-SEUNG FILM

10
00:02:01,372 --> 00:02:05,626
Open your ears to hear
the people

11
00:02:07,753 --> 00:02:13,425
Calm thy heart first
for the affairs of the nation

12
00:02:17,179 --> 00:02:23,310
THE CONCUBINE

13
00:02:33,154 --> 00:02:36,157
I apologize once again, sir

14
00:02:36,824 --> 00:02:39,827
He is such a reckless lad

15
00:02:42,163 --> 00:02:44,456
Perhaps your son should join us

16
00:02:44,665 --> 00:02:47,459
No, sir!
He is not my son, sir

17
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:53,674
He once saved my life at war,
so I took him in like a son

18
00:02:54,091 --> 00:02:55,968
You ruined the prince's hunt!

19
00:02:56,218 --> 00:02:58,095
- Let's go!
- How scary!

20
00:02:58,429 --> 00:03:03,475
- The prince is but a thief!
- How dare you!

21
00:03:04,226 --> 00:03:05,060
Fool!

22
00:03:06,187 --> 00:03:07,730
Let him go at once!

23
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:11,609
What have I done wrong?

24
00:03:12,359 --> 00:03:15,112
There is an order
to catching deer, too?

25
00:03:15,487 --> 00:03:17,114
How dare you!

26
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:19,491
Lock him away at once!

27
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:20,868
- Yes, sir!
- Kwon-yoo?

28
00:03:36,467 --> 00:03:41,889
I apologize for the disturbance,
Your Highness

29
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:44,016
Please forgive me

30
00:03:52,775 --> 00:03:54,735
Wait until the guest has left

31
00:03:58,656 --> 00:03:59,365
Why?

32
00:04:02,243 --> 00:04:03,410
What worries you so?

33
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:08,415
Don't worry

34
00:04:16,757 --> 00:04:19,134
I do not hear you reading
these days

35
00:04:22,096 --> 00:04:25,891
Just rumors of you wandering out
in mad hunting

36
00:04:27,518 --> 00:04:32,231
To not fall weak, men not only
study but hunt and...

37
00:04:37,486 --> 00:04:38,779
That is not what I meant

38
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:44,785
Why do you frequent
Deputy-Minister Shin's house?

39
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:47,913
Because of his daughter?

40
00:04:53,794 --> 00:04:56,046
A mere deputy-minister's girl?

41
00:05:02,177 --> 00:05:03,554
I've never felt
this way before

42
00:05:03,554 --> 00:05:08,392
The court is always critical of
the king's half brother

43
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:11,937
Stay away from her

44
00:05:13,272 --> 00:05:18,569
It is only right that
I visit you often, stepmother

45
00:05:19,028 --> 00:05:20,571
You still call me stepmother, sire?

46
00:05:22,573 --> 00:05:26,327
I fret you come
to keep watch on me

47
00:05:28,662 --> 00:05:29,705
Of course not

48
00:05:30,205 --> 00:05:33,459
With no son and
not even a concubine

49
00:05:35,085 --> 00:05:38,297
They say I'm stopping you
with ulterior motives

50
00:05:39,423 --> 00:05:46,680
It is only because
I feel sorry to my late queen

51
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:52,811
Though I am a stepmother,
I have my courtly duties

52
00:05:57,358 --> 00:06:03,989
Then, please find
a new queen for me

53
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:09,328
I shall see to it immediately

54
00:06:12,873 --> 00:06:13,749
Who is it?

55
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:22,216
Sir! Come in!

56
00:06:29,014 --> 00:06:30,224
Your Highness!

57
00:06:31,016 --> 00:06:35,521
How could you
do this to me?

58
00:06:35,521 --> 00:06:39,900
Sir! It is late
Let us go in and talk

59
00:06:42,778 --> 00:06:45,531
Did you not promise me?

60
00:06:45,531 --> 00:06:52,788
Yes, but how could I go against
the court's orders, sir?

61
00:06:52,788 --> 00:06:55,541
Why?
Does she not fancy me?

62
00:06:55,541 --> 00:06:59,128
- Let's go in, sir!
- Call your daughter out!

63
00:06:59,128 --> 00:07:00,921
Let's go inside

64
00:07:00,921 --> 00:07:06,552
I must talk with her!
Where is she?

65
00:07:33,579 --> 00:07:37,291
Since you went against the court,
you must run for life

66
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:42,588
I'm not going anywhere alone

67
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:47,426
But there's nothing
I can do for you

68
00:07:57,311 --> 00:07:58,687
Just stay with me

69
00:09:03,961 --> 00:09:04,586
Kwonyoo!

70
00:09:06,171 --> 00:09:10,551
Kwonyoo!

71
00:09:11,343 --> 00:09:12,219
Escort her away!

72
00:09:12,678 --> 00:09:13,845
Kwonyoo!

73
00:09:17,599 --> 00:09:18,308
No!

74
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:20,352
- No!
- Hwayeon!

75
00:09:20,727 --> 00:09:21,228
Let go!

76
00:09:23,855 --> 00:09:24,690
- Kwonyoo!
- Hwayeon!

77
00:09:26,358 --> 00:09:28,235
No!

78
00:09:41,373 --> 00:09:42,833
No, Father!

79
00:09:42,833 --> 00:09:45,752
I suggested we run away
Kwonyoo is innocent!

80
00:09:46,461 --> 00:09:52,384
If this gets known,
we'll all die including him

81
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:53,969
Please let him go

82
00:09:54,886 --> 00:09:56,263
It's too late

83
00:09:57,139 --> 00:09:58,265
- Guards!
- Yes, sir!

84
00:09:59,725 --> 00:10:01,018
I'll go in the palace!

85
00:10:02,644 --> 00:10:05,647
If Kwonyoo dies, so will I!

86
00:10:11,612 --> 00:10:12,904
Let go!

87
00:10:16,033 --> 00:10:18,035
What have you done to her!

88
00:10:18,035 --> 00:10:20,037
Hwayeon!

89
00:10:57,824 --> 00:10:58,909
I Will do it

90
00:11:01,036 --> 00:11:03,789
There are rules and steps
to bathing, too

91
00:11:05,916 --> 00:11:08,168
I have no right
to my own body?

92
00:11:13,715 --> 00:11:14,925
5 YEARS LATER

93
00:11:14,966 --> 00:11:17,803
Your Majesty
Prince Sung-won is here

94
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:24,601
It's been so long
How've you been, brother?

95
00:11:26,812 --> 00:11:29,064
Just roaming
here and there, sire

96
00:11:35,821 --> 00:11:40,951
I'm ashamed to see you
so weak and pale, sire

97
00:11:41,493 --> 00:11:48,458
I feel much better
seeing you

98
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:54,631
How are things outside?

99
00:11:56,717 --> 00:12:02,139
The grain and crops have
fully ripened, sire

100
00:12:03,515 --> 00:12:07,894
Your people are making spirits
with Chrysanthemums

101
00:12:26,913 --> 00:12:29,624
Recently, he's been ill
quite often

102
00:12:31,376 --> 00:12:35,255
I'm afraid the court physician
does not know why

103
00:12:38,049 --> 00:12:42,179
He'll regain his health soon
Don't fret, Your Majesty

104
00:12:44,431 --> 00:12:47,934
You left so suddenly
I was worried

105
00:12:51,438 --> 00:12:53,398
You worried about me?

106
00:12:59,571 --> 00:13:02,574
How foolish of me
to worry you both

107
00:13:02,574 --> 00:13:04,826
I'm glad you've returned safely

108
00:13:06,161 --> 00:13:09,706
I came upon hearing
His Majesty's ill

109
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:12,542
I shall leave when he recovers

110
00:13:16,546 --> 00:13:21,301
It'd be a burden on you and
my nephew for me to stay

111
00:13:22,302 --> 00:13:25,722
What burden?
His Majesty welcomes you so

112
00:13:40,695 --> 00:13:44,241
I've taken up too much of
your time, Your Majesty

113
00:14:07,889 --> 00:14:10,892
His Majesty appears
blue and lifeless

114
00:14:11,518 --> 00:14:15,355
Someone is deliberately trying
to assassinate him

115
00:14:15,355 --> 00:14:20,652
- Assassinate? How dare you?
- Sirs! Let's calm down

116
00:14:23,113 --> 00:14:25,115
Let's listen to the court
physician

117
00:14:27,242 --> 00:14:32,372
He's grown weak from boils
and can't eat well

118
00:14:32,372 --> 00:14:34,374
Perhaps it's the food!

119
00:14:34,374 --> 00:14:39,796
If so, we must interrogate
the royal kitchen matron!

120
00:14:40,881 --> 00:14:43,049
That's preposterous

121
00:14:43,049 --> 00:14:47,679
We can always do that after
His Majesty recovers

122
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:49,431
What do you mean?

123
00:14:50,056 --> 00:14:53,643
We must get to the truth
behind His Majesty's illness

124
00:14:58,398 --> 00:15:03,028
His Majesty's state is critical

125
00:15:03,028 --> 00:15:05,322
Please come another day

126
00:15:05,322 --> 00:15:06,948
What do you mean?

127
00:15:06,948 --> 00:15:09,075
I am His Majesty's mother!

128
00:15:09,075 --> 00:15:10,201
Step aside

129
00:15:10,201 --> 00:15:10,827
Your Majesty!

130
00:15:12,203 --> 00:15:15,290
Why do you keep me from
meeting my ailing son!

131
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:19,711
I must see how he is at once!

132
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:26,426
His Majesty must rest now
Ask her to go for today

133
00:15:27,594 --> 00:15:31,306
Is the queen implying that
I'd interfere in his health?

134
00:15:34,601 --> 00:15:37,729
- My acupuncture set! Hurry!
- Yes, sir

135
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:55,121
He isn't breathing!

136
00:15:56,373 --> 00:15:58,124
Don't just watch!
Do something!

137
00:16:18,228 --> 00:16:20,146
This is a vital spot

138
00:16:38,665 --> 00:16:44,295
- Please appoint your successor!
- Please, Your Majesty!

139
00:17:14,367 --> 00:17:17,120
Your Majesty!

140
00:17:18,997 --> 00:17:20,665
Your Majesty!

141
00:17:23,293 --> 00:17:29,924
Your Majesty!

142
00:17:32,302 --> 00:17:44,064
Your Majesty!

143
00:17:55,825 --> 00:17:58,578
Farewell, My King!

144
00:18:00,705 --> 00:18:04,209
Farewell, My King!

145
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:08,922
Farewell, My King!

146
00:18:08,922 --> 00:18:11,591
Well done, Minister Yoon

147
00:18:12,967 --> 00:18:16,179
But the prince and queen
are still alive

148
00:18:17,222 --> 00:18:21,601
The queen's father also
has many followers

149
00:18:32,612 --> 00:18:35,448
How hard can a woman
and her child be?

150
00:18:39,369 --> 00:18:44,624
Without the Left-State Minister
and her father, she won't last

151
00:18:51,089 --> 00:18:56,261
We must push ahead
before the Queen Mother

152
00:18:57,512 --> 00:18:59,639
She has the power
to appoint the next king

153
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,976
They are not to be messed with

154
00:19:04,894 --> 00:19:09,149
If you're ousted here,

155
00:19:09,149 --> 00:19:12,110
you and the prince will be in danger

156
00:19:13,778 --> 00:19:14,529
By the way

157
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:17,657
This is the royal kitchen's log

158
00:19:18,491 --> 00:19:22,287
There's nothing around the day of
the king's sudden illness

159
00:19:23,788 --> 00:19:24,747
That means...

160
00:19:24,747 --> 00:19:28,626
Yes. The matron who records
the log is also missing

161
00:19:29,419 --> 00:19:34,424
She must be hidden away
somewhere inside the palace

162
00:19:35,675 --> 00:19:36,759
Inside here?

163
00:19:36,759 --> 00:19:37,635
Yes

164
00:19:38,178 --> 00:19:43,766
We must find her and prove
His Majesty was assassinated

165
00:19:45,018 --> 00:19:51,566
With proof, I can gather up forces
with some ministers

166
00:19:51,566 --> 00:19:53,943
How dare you!

167
00:19:53,943 --> 00:19:57,155
They're conspirators of
high treason!

168
00:19:57,155 --> 00:19:58,698
- Seize them!
- Yes, sir!

169
00:19:59,199 --> 00:20:00,283
High treason?

170
00:20:01,784 --> 00:20:04,329
Why you!

171
00:20:04,329 --> 00:20:05,830
Have you no fear of heaven!

172
00:20:07,457 --> 00:20:10,043
There is a new heaven now!

173
00:20:10,043 --> 00:20:12,337
The queen's father
is charged with treason!

174
00:20:12,962 --> 00:20:13,838
What?

175
00:20:14,422 --> 00:20:17,717
The Queen Mother has ordered
his arrest for treason

176
00:20:19,093 --> 00:20:19,969
Fools!

177
00:20:21,804 --> 00:20:24,807
How dare you!
Go away at once!

178
00:20:25,225 --> 00:20:25,975
Over there!

179
00:20:28,853 --> 00:20:29,479
Stop!

180
00:20:34,442 --> 00:20:35,485
Fools!

181
00:20:46,996 --> 00:20:51,376
This color was made
with red sage in lye

182
00:20:52,126 --> 00:20:53,878
It must be soaked
hundreds of times

183
00:20:55,088 --> 00:20:58,841
to get this bright,
blood-like color

184
00:20:59,968 --> 00:21:03,888
It absorbs all other colors
to shine even brighter

185
00:21:05,598 --> 00:21:07,016
It's the king's color

186
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:13,898
Your Majesty!

187
00:21:33,418 --> 00:21:37,046
It's not our duty to take part
in the court's affairs

188
00:21:37,922 --> 00:21:40,925
We look after
His Majesty's necessities

189
00:21:40,925 --> 00:21:44,679
We maintain the court's order
and customs

190
00:21:44,679 --> 00:21:48,266
We are invisible hands
that keep the palace running

191
00:21:50,184 --> 00:21:54,439
We exist only for His Majesty
and the royal court

192
00:21:55,898 --> 00:21:59,944
You must all remember
and never forget that

193
00:22:00,695 --> 00:22:01,446
Yes, sir!

194
00:22:01,904 --> 00:22:05,158
It hasn't been long since
His Majesty's been crowned

195
00:22:05,158 --> 00:22:09,037
Thus, the court eunuchs will also
stand guard for a while

196
00:22:09,537 --> 00:22:11,956
If you fall,
His Majesty is at risk!

197
00:22:13,041 --> 00:22:13,833
Stand and fight!

198
00:22:15,335 --> 00:22:16,044
Stand and fight!

199
00:22:16,919 --> 00:22:18,212
Who is that lad?

200
00:22:18,212 --> 00:22:20,673
Minister Yoon recommended him

201
00:22:20,673 --> 00:22:25,178
Minister Yoon?
He'll be the new power here

202
00:22:25,178 --> 00:22:25,970
What do you mean?

203
00:22:26,971 --> 00:22:28,931
Don't feign innocence

204
00:22:30,224 --> 00:22:35,688
You're safe for now,
but anything can happen

205
00:22:35,688 --> 00:22:41,319
If you want to stay here long,
stay close to him

206
00:22:41,986 --> 00:22:44,364
Worried about your post?

207
00:22:44,364 --> 00:22:45,990
You must be getting old

208
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:47,367
What's more important
than that?

209
00:22:48,701 --> 00:22:51,079
I almost lost my life last time

210
00:22:52,705 --> 00:22:57,001
I trust you'll keep
watching over me

211
00:23:18,773 --> 00:23:19,857
Your Majesty

212
00:23:21,234 --> 00:23:24,237
Lie to the left of the queen

213
00:23:29,283 --> 00:23:30,034
Your Majesty

214
00:23:31,369 --> 00:23:35,665
Lie over her with your heart
to the left

215
00:23:37,417 --> 00:23:45,633
Lick and suckle her lips
then swallow her saliva, sire

216
00:23:48,636 --> 00:23:53,433
Softly rub her lower stomach

217
00:23:54,642 --> 00:23:56,561
Then, caress down farther

218
00:23:58,688 --> 00:24:06,446
Wait until her breasts harden,
then grasp them firmly, sire

219
00:24:08,406 --> 00:24:09,157
Your Majesty

220
00:24:10,408 --> 00:24:12,577
Begin intercourse, sire

221
00:24:14,537 --> 00:24:19,333
The queen must grab his waist

222
00:24:19,333 --> 00:24:22,962
and accept his royal penis

223
00:24:22,962 --> 00:24:28,468
I am ready, sire
Let it in

224
00:24:44,984 --> 00:24:46,819
Go slowly, sire

225
00:25:04,504 --> 00:25:07,131
Next is the anal position

226
00:25:36,536 --> 00:25:37,870
Not yet, sire!

227
00:25:38,913 --> 00:25:43,543
You must ejaculate later
to impregnate a son

228
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:28,421
Please return to
your chambers, sire

229
00:26:33,718 --> 00:26:36,721
If the Queen Mother knew...

230
00:26:42,852 --> 00:26:43,728
What happened?

231
00:26:44,228 --> 00:26:47,189
I couldn't say a word
in the royal kitchen

232
00:26:48,232 --> 00:26:50,860
The maids run away
when they see me

233
00:26:56,866 --> 00:26:58,868
We must find
the royal kitchen matron

234
00:27:05,708 --> 00:27:06,375
Your Highness?

235
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:10,463
You found something?
Tell me

236
00:27:11,255 --> 00:27:15,593
Well, if she is still alive...

237
00:27:19,138 --> 00:27:22,642
I once heard the eunuchs
whispering

238
00:27:24,018 --> 00:27:28,773
Past the Queen Mother's court
and the laundry place

239
00:27:29,649 --> 00:27:32,151
I heard there is a secret
pathway underground

240
00:27:33,903 --> 00:27:39,784
No sunlight can get through,
But it snows all day there

241
00:27:42,119 --> 00:27:49,043
And only the Queen Mother's
private soldiers know of it

242
00:27:49,043 --> 00:27:50,127
You wretch!

243
00:27:51,003 --> 00:27:57,176
Greet the late king's concubine
at once!

244
00:27:59,136 --> 00:28:00,304
How dare you?

245
00:28:01,806 --> 00:28:04,684
Bring me a table
of food and wine!

246
00:28:07,311 --> 00:28:10,940
His Majesty will come
any moment

247
00:28:15,027 --> 00:28:17,405
What's taking so long?

248
00:28:17,405 --> 00:28:21,826
Why'd you come out?
Let's return to your room

249
00:28:22,410 --> 00:28:25,454
Let's put some makeup on
and change your clothes

250
00:28:27,164 --> 00:28:28,582
Why sure

251
00:28:56,986 --> 00:28:57,862
Your Highness!

252
00:28:59,739 --> 00:29:00,364
Your Highness!

253
00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:01,866
Your Highness!

254
00:29:02,992 --> 00:29:04,869
Please get me out of here

255
00:29:05,953 --> 00:29:08,706
I just did as I was told

256
00:29:08,706 --> 00:29:09,582
Calm down

257
00:29:12,251 --> 00:29:14,336
And take a look at this

258
00:29:19,633 --> 00:29:21,135
Did you write this?

259
00:29:22,219 --> 00:29:23,012
Yes, Your Highness

260
00:29:26,223 --> 00:29:26,891
But

261
00:29:26,891 --> 00:29:30,519
Do you remember what
His Majesty ate that day?

262
00:29:32,521 --> 00:29:36,650
He had lunch at
the Queen Mother's court

263
00:29:37,985 --> 00:29:39,528
The Queen Mother?

264
00:29:43,783 --> 00:29:48,788
She suddenly called His Majesty
and ordered us not to prepare lunch

265
00:29:51,749 --> 00:29:55,377
Why? Is it not to your liking?

266
00:29:55,377 --> 00:30:00,299
It's because I have indigestion

267
00:30:00,299 --> 00:30:04,178
Afraid it's poisoned, sire?

268
00:30:05,930 --> 00:30:06,680
Of course not

269
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:12,186
They say you are ill
because I'm poisoning you

270
00:30:15,648 --> 00:30:19,443
Then, he had diarrhea
all night

271
00:30:33,666 --> 00:30:37,962
You two dare defile
the palace order?

272
00:30:39,213 --> 00:30:42,299
Make sure they never forget
their sins!

273
00:30:50,558 --> 00:30:54,353
Cut off the atrocious
fool's penis!

274
00:30:55,688 --> 00:30:59,066
Remove her womb
and sew her genitals!

275
00:30:59,066 --> 00:31:01,735
Show them the strict
order of the court!

276
00:31:02,319 --> 00:31:02,987
Yes, ma'am!

277
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:16,375
You have such soft hands

278
00:31:19,003 --> 00:31:20,129
I know, sir

279
00:31:33,893 --> 00:31:36,020
Your Majesty

280
00:31:37,646 --> 00:31:38,647
Who are you?

281
00:31:38,898 --> 00:31:43,235
Please kill me.
I mean, no!

282
00:31:44,028 --> 00:31:45,905
I asked who you are

283
00:31:48,115 --> 00:31:49,658
I deserve to die

284
00:31:50,117 --> 00:31:53,245
She is Her Highness' maid
from home

285
00:31:58,918 --> 00:32:03,130
Please forgive me, sire

286
00:32:33,327 --> 00:32:35,955
What brings you to this
humble sire?

287
00:32:37,206 --> 00:32:42,211
I haven't visited since
you moved to this place

288
00:32:45,339 --> 00:32:49,468
Where did you go at night
with no guards?

289
00:32:49,468 --> 00:32:54,598
My father is locked up
How could I just sit and wait?

290
00:32:55,849 --> 00:32:56,684
I apologize

291
00:32:58,102 --> 00:33:00,479
I've been too busy with things

292
00:33:02,982 --> 00:33:04,817
You must be devastated

293
00:33:06,110 --> 00:33:09,822
I shall see to
your father's release

294
00:33:11,115 --> 00:33:14,326
I cannot be a burden
on you, sire

295
00:33:15,828 --> 00:33:21,375
I am just grateful
to be alive

296
00:33:28,007 --> 00:33:31,593
It must be uncomfortable
in this old place

297
00:33:33,345 --> 00:33:34,513
Chief Eunuch!

298
00:33:39,768 --> 00:33:43,272
Furnish this place suited
to Her Highness

299
00:33:43,772 --> 00:33:48,652
That is under jurisdiction
of the Queen Mother, sire

300
00:33:49,528 --> 00:33:50,029
What?

301
00:33:51,363 --> 00:33:52,281
It's her jurisdiction?

302
00:33:56,285 --> 00:33:59,663
So, you won't follow
the king's order?

303
00:34:08,172 --> 00:34:09,798
Your Highness!
Look at this!

304
00:34:14,219 --> 00:34:16,555
His Majesty sent
such nice things

305
00:34:16,847 --> 00:34:17,473
This way!

306
00:34:19,725 --> 00:34:25,481
Embankment work on Nakdong River
damaged tributary

307
00:34:26,106 --> 00:34:28,984
The peasant shares in great harm

308
00:34:29,735 --> 00:34:34,490
With the rainy season
320 homes were lost

309
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:39,244
And over 200 people
went missing

310
00:34:39,244 --> 00:34:42,748
Apart from what's required,
reduce the taxes

311
00:34:42,748 --> 00:34:45,584
Order all district magistrates

312
00:34:45,584 --> 00:34:50,214
to send soldiers to help the people

313
00:34:50,714 --> 00:34:56,470
Next is a list of pardoned sinners
in honor of the coronation

314
00:34:58,889 --> 00:35:02,351
Excluding murders
and high treason

315
00:35:02,351 --> 00:35:06,605
280 sinners in the capital
and 137 elsewhere were...

316
00:35:06,605 --> 00:35:08,232
Do you people not see me?

317
00:35:09,149 --> 00:35:11,902
Why don't you submit
reports to me?

318
00:35:11,902 --> 00:35:16,907
While His Majesty learns affairs,
the Queen Mother is...

319
00:35:16,907 --> 00:35:21,411
Does it look like I'm learning
by just sitting here?

320
00:35:23,163 --> 00:35:27,042
From now on, prepare reports
for him to see as well

321
00:35:28,377 --> 00:35:29,169
Continue

322
00:35:30,129 --> 00:35:31,630
Is the queen's father
on the list?

323
00:35:48,897 --> 00:35:50,274
Have you lost your mind?

324
00:35:51,441 --> 00:35:55,571
Do you not know for whom
they are being purged?

325
00:35:57,281 --> 00:35:59,700
The former queen's father
has many followers

326
00:36:00,826 --> 00:36:07,583
I fret it'll perturb
the people

327
00:36:09,710 --> 00:36:11,211
You kept watch on me?

328
00:36:13,297 --> 00:36:16,800
Though you act as regent,
I am still the king

329
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:17,843
You're not ready

330
00:36:19,469 --> 00:36:23,599
Mentioning personal feelings
at court is no king!

331
00:36:26,977 --> 00:36:28,854
Forgotten how we made it here?

332
00:36:31,857 --> 00:36:34,818
If we don't nip the bud,
we could get hurt again

333
00:36:38,697 --> 00:36:41,491
We almost died when your court
was on fire

334
00:36:43,118 --> 00:36:45,704
I've never once forgotten that

335
00:36:45,704 --> 00:36:49,625
Please stop mentioning that

336
00:36:51,877 --> 00:36:55,088
Every woman in the palace
is yours, but one!

337
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:59,343
You can never touch
that woman

338
00:37:04,139 --> 00:37:06,642
Bring all the eunuchs
at the former queen's court!

339
00:37:06,642 --> 00:37:08,143
What have I done wrong?

340
00:37:09,228 --> 00:37:11,271
I did all you wanted,
Mother

341
00:37:12,147 --> 00:37:13,774
I accepted her as
sister-in-law

342
00:37:14,358 --> 00:37:15,901
And became the king
as you wished!

343
00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:18,904
What more do you want from me?

344
00:37:42,302 --> 00:37:45,514
If the bee will not shoo away

345
00:37:46,306 --> 00:37:48,558
the flower will be cut off

346
00:37:56,775 --> 00:37:57,651
Get me a drink

347
00:38:25,679 --> 00:38:26,722
Hwayeon!

348
00:38:33,353 --> 00:38:36,231
Hwayeon!

349
00:38:38,191 --> 00:38:40,110
I took you in
like my own son

350
00:38:40,986 --> 00:38:43,363
How dare you covet
my daughter!

351
00:38:43,363 --> 00:38:45,198
Hwayeon!

352
00:38:46,325 --> 00:38:51,371
Remember why I let you live
And never come to us again

353
00:38:51,830 --> 00:38:52,622
- Guards!
- Yes, sir!

354
00:38:53,332 --> 00:38:56,877
- Castrate him at once!
- Yes, sir!

355
00:39:24,404 --> 00:39:28,033
Kwonyoo?
How did you come here?

356
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,293
I thought you were dead

357
00:39:41,046 --> 00:39:45,884
No. I prayed every moment
for you to be alive

358
00:39:47,052 --> 00:39:47,928
Kwonyoo

359
00:39:50,013 --> 00:39:54,643
I'm so glad to see you
alive and well

360
00:39:57,062 --> 00:40:01,066
Kwonyoo died back then, madam

361
00:40:02,401 --> 00:40:06,071
What do you mean?
Please help me

362
00:40:07,197 --> 00:40:10,283
I have no clue
what is happening

363
00:40:12,202 --> 00:40:14,538
I found evidence
the king's been murdered

364
00:40:16,415 --> 00:40:18,041
Please, go back

365
00:40:20,085 --> 00:40:24,548
Do you not know
I'm Minister Yoon's man?

366
00:40:26,967 --> 00:40:29,094
What do you mean?

367
00:40:35,851 --> 00:40:40,063
You're the only one
I have in the palace

368
00:40:41,481 --> 00:40:42,232
Kwonyoo

369
00:40:44,443 --> 00:40:45,235
How could you?

370
00:40:49,865 --> 00:40:54,494
How could I be of any help now?

371
00:40:57,122 --> 00:41:01,376
What more do you want in life?

372
00:41:05,589 --> 00:41:10,886
If you want to live,
run away alone

373
00:41:13,763 --> 00:41:15,265
Alone again

374
00:41:18,268 --> 00:41:19,352
Like before

375
00:41:22,397 --> 00:41:24,107
Run by yourself

376
00:41:29,029 --> 00:41:30,363
No visitors are allowed

377
00:41:31,281 --> 00:41:36,161
Still, Her Highness is here

378
00:41:36,161 --> 00:41:38,246
Just for a moment?

379
00:41:38,246 --> 00:41:40,790
I could lose my head
I'm sorry

380
00:41:45,045 --> 00:41:49,424
Could you at least give this
to my elderly father?

381
00:41:50,675 --> 00:41:51,635
It's rice gruel

382
00:42:19,454 --> 00:42:21,414
Your daughter sent this

383
00:42:33,426 --> 00:42:34,302
You?

384
00:42:37,722 --> 00:42:39,349
How did you come here?

385
00:42:42,978 --> 00:42:44,938
Such a dangerous act

386
00:42:47,357 --> 00:42:51,820
My daughter is innocent

387
00:42:55,115 --> 00:42:59,494
I heard what happened
from the royal kitchen matron

388
00:42:59,494 --> 00:43:01,705
Who should I tell this to?

389
00:43:03,081 --> 00:43:08,378
Look. I'll die for my sin
But not her!

390
00:43:13,216 --> 00:43:17,846
You should've killed me
back then

391
00:43:24,603 --> 00:43:29,733
Stop! Come back!

392
00:43:36,239 --> 00:43:37,741
How is the former queen?

393
00:43:39,534 --> 00:43:42,370
She is well, Your Majesty

394
00:43:44,789 --> 00:43:49,377
Visit her day and night
to make sure she's well

395
00:43:51,796 --> 00:43:52,631
Yes, sire

396
00:43:53,673 --> 00:43:55,550
How dare you?

397
00:43:55,550 --> 00:43:59,304
Persimmon is harmful to
His Majesty's boils

398
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:02,265
What is your name?

399
00:44:02,932 --> 00:44:04,309
Choongyoung, sire

400
00:44:04,309 --> 00:44:06,436
How'd you know
I have boils?

401
00:44:07,187 --> 00:44:11,316
I knew from how you hesitated
leaning against your back

402
00:44:11,524 --> 00:44:15,654
Tell me, how can boils
be subdued?

403
00:44:15,654 --> 00:44:22,035
Sweat and chills can cause
boils to form easily, sire

404
00:44:22,327 --> 00:44:26,081
It is best to avoid
raw or cold foods

405
00:44:26,081 --> 00:44:27,040
You seem familiar

406
00:44:28,541 --> 00:44:29,959
Have we met before?

407
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:35,090
No, sire. How can a lowly man
meet His Majesty?

408
00:44:36,716 --> 00:44:41,554
I like this lad
Promote him as senior eunuch

409
00:44:42,972 --> 00:44:43,723
Your Majesty

410
00:44:44,307 --> 00:44:48,728
To become a senior,
one must work over 16 years

411
00:44:49,604 --> 00:44:52,941
It took him over 20 years
to reach that post to be here

412
00:44:53,483 --> 00:44:56,361
- This man came in recently
- What?

413
00:44:57,487 --> 00:45:00,699
Can't I do as I wish
even with a eunuch?

414
00:45:01,366 --> 00:45:02,367
Why?

415
00:45:02,367 --> 00:45:05,370
Do you only follow
the Queen Mother, too?

416
00:45:06,705 --> 00:45:08,123
As you wish, sire

417
00:45:25,014 --> 00:45:27,267
What brings Your Highness
here this late?

418
00:45:29,602 --> 00:45:30,895
Is it this?

419
00:45:31,396 --> 00:45:32,272
Kwonyoo

420
00:45:33,231 --> 00:45:35,483
They will be beheaded at dawn

421
00:45:37,026 --> 00:45:39,362
Why make the effort?

422
00:45:41,030 --> 00:45:44,534
The poor kitchen matron
died because of you

423
00:45:50,623 --> 00:45:52,792
Madam? What is it?

424
00:45:53,543 --> 00:46:00,175
I must watch my father die
for we couldn't die with the king

425
00:46:00,759 --> 00:46:03,762
Please kill us first, sire

426
00:46:04,804 --> 00:46:08,933
Beheading the former
queen's father is too harsh

427
00:46:10,059 --> 00:46:11,561
Please take back the order

428
00:46:13,062 --> 00:46:14,939
The court has already decided

429
00:46:17,817 --> 00:46:19,569
Please save her father!

430
00:46:20,445 --> 00:46:22,447
I will do whatever you want

431
00:46:24,282 --> 00:46:26,576
I will no longer seek her!

432
00:46:26,576 --> 00:46:30,955
Loyal ministers wish this
to stabilize your reign!

433
00:46:32,665 --> 00:46:34,083
No further discussion

434
00:46:39,798 --> 00:46:41,090
Who do you speak of?

435
00:46:43,551 --> 00:46:46,805
The relatives on your side
who all hold posts?

436
00:46:54,479 --> 00:46:59,234
She must suffer so because
the late king didn't kill us?

437
00:46:59,234 --> 00:47:00,985
Watch what you say!

438
00:47:00,985 --> 00:47:05,490
Am I this nation's king at all?

439
00:47:08,326 --> 00:47:13,456
Not this time
It won't be as you wish

440
00:47:14,249 --> 00:47:15,375
Sire!

441
00:47:15,375 --> 00:47:18,211
- Chief Eunuch?
- Yes, sire

442
00:47:19,379 --> 00:47:21,714
Run and stop the execution

443
00:47:24,092 --> 00:47:27,887
Changing the Queen Mother's
order will...

444
00:47:35,395 --> 00:47:36,354
Then, you go!

445
00:47:39,899 --> 00:47:43,152
No judgments
That is not up to us

446
00:47:59,294 --> 00:48:02,046
All hear His Majesty's command!

447
00:48:02,881 --> 00:48:07,176
Shin Ik-chul and his men
have plotted high treason

448
00:48:08,428 --> 00:48:10,513
And endangered the court

449
00:48:11,556 --> 00:48:16,269
By law, their entire family
must die and...

450
00:48:16,269 --> 00:48:18,813
Wretched fool!

451
00:48:19,689 --> 00:48:25,320
You poisoned the late king
to death!

452
00:48:26,529 --> 00:48:27,655
Off with his head!

453
00:48:55,308 --> 00:48:56,225
Step aside!

454
00:48:57,310 --> 00:48:59,354
I must speak with her!

455
00:48:59,354 --> 00:49:00,188
Your Majesty

456
00:49:01,481 --> 00:49:02,106
Sire!

457
00:49:03,232 --> 00:49:04,108
Please calm down

458
00:49:04,609 --> 00:49:05,360
Why you!

459
00:49:48,778 --> 00:49:51,531
Perhaps it's best
to go, sire

460
00:50:04,794 --> 00:50:06,796
There. Checkmate

461
00:50:07,672 --> 00:50:08,756
Let me see

462
00:50:09,382 --> 00:50:12,051
Oh no. Take back
just one move?

463
00:50:12,635 --> 00:50:15,513
Again?
Nothing comes for free

464
00:50:16,305 --> 00:50:19,308
I have nothing but my balls
Want that?

465
00:50:20,268 --> 00:50:23,771
Testicles? Why sure!
I've been dying for them

466
00:50:23,771 --> 00:50:24,814
I'll take back 10 moves!

467
00:50:28,776 --> 00:50:32,030
Why look like
you just stepped in shit?

468
00:50:32,905 --> 00:50:34,657
How is the game?

469
00:50:34,657 --> 00:50:37,285
I always win, but it's not fun

470
00:50:38,828 --> 00:50:41,080
Why? Trouble in the court?

471
00:50:42,457 --> 00:50:46,085
30 years here, I thought
I knew it inside out

472
00:50:47,211 --> 00:50:50,840
But I'm still not sure of
what is right or wrong

473
00:50:51,716 --> 00:50:52,842
Why you

474
00:50:53,718 --> 00:50:57,430
It's hard to tell who is right
because everyone is right

475
00:51:00,475 --> 00:51:07,065
When I cut off my balls to come here
I sealed off reasoning, too

476
00:51:07,065 --> 00:51:12,236
It's not about right or wrong
Just having power or not here

477
00:51:12,737 --> 00:51:13,821
Wait

478
00:51:13,821 --> 00:51:17,617
Did I just say that?
Not bad, aren't I?

479
00:51:17,617 --> 00:51:19,494
Yes. Indeed

480
00:51:21,996 --> 00:51:25,333
What would you have become
instead of a eunuch?

481
00:51:26,959 --> 00:51:31,130
Just leading a happy life
with a wife and kids

482
00:51:34,592 --> 00:51:35,510
Forget it

483
00:51:36,260 --> 00:51:40,014
Unless we die,
we can't ever leave here

484
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:46,771
You fool!

485
00:51:46,771 --> 00:51:50,108
Testing to see if my eyes
will pop out or not?

486
00:51:50,108 --> 00:51:53,778
I can't stand him!

487
00:51:58,282 --> 00:52:00,743
KING

488
00:52:00,743 --> 00:52:05,498
It is obvious for whom
they plotted treason

489
00:52:05,498 --> 00:52:10,878
Depose the former queen
and banish her and her son

490
00:52:10,878 --> 00:52:13,047
Your Majesty

491
00:52:13,047 --> 00:52:20,304
Please punish the former queen
to avoid any future harm

492
00:52:20,304 --> 00:52:25,184
Our king isn't coming again?

493
00:52:25,184 --> 00:52:29,564
Your Majesty
Please give the order

494
00:52:29,564 --> 00:52:32,692
Please give the order!

495
00:52:32,692 --> 00:52:37,572
Find reason against her
to persuade the king first!

496
00:52:40,283 --> 00:52:41,325
Dismissed

497
00:52:43,828 --> 00:52:44,829
Your Majesty

498
00:52:45,538 --> 00:52:50,418
Please depose and banish them

499
00:52:56,340 --> 00:52:57,592
Call the Chief Minister

500
00:53:00,344 --> 00:53:01,679
Why not look at me?

501
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:09,979
I am embarrassed to see you
without your proper robes, sire

502
00:53:12,190 --> 00:53:13,608
This is embarrassing?

503
00:53:14,442 --> 00:53:18,863
You who clearly show ulterior
motives is far more shameless

504
00:53:22,992 --> 00:53:24,327
I'll ask one thing

505
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:27,997
What trait is most important
to be king?

506
00:53:28,623 --> 00:53:32,335
Showing virtue
with humanity, sire

507
00:53:32,627 --> 00:53:36,088
Then, what is the root of
humanity?

508
00:53:39,508 --> 00:53:42,011
Compassion, sire

509
00:53:42,011 --> 00:53:45,139
Is banishing a widow
compassion?

510
00:53:46,766 --> 00:53:50,394
- Is that a virtuous deed?
- But, sire

511
00:53:50,394 --> 00:53:54,398
You can kill us all,
but think of the court and...

512
00:53:54,398 --> 00:53:55,900
Old fool!

513
00:53:56,734 --> 00:54:01,364
Do you think the Queen Mother's
regency will last forever?

514
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:06,535
Take the others and go
Or you'll get your wish to die!

515
00:54:08,537 --> 00:54:09,997
Go away at once!

516
00:54:40,945 --> 00:54:42,446
His Majesty has arrived

517
00:54:46,575 --> 00:54:47,201
Stay here

518
00:54:48,828 --> 00:54:51,914
Please return
during the day, sire

519
00:54:53,457 --> 00:54:54,709
I heard you are ill

520
00:54:55,710 --> 00:54:59,422
With my father's head up
on the street, how can I be well?

521
00:55:01,966 --> 00:55:03,592
Is that why you avoid me so?

522
00:55:08,597 --> 00:55:12,727
Do you know what is happening
in the court?

523
00:55:12,727 --> 00:55:14,687
I know very well, sire

524
00:55:15,313 --> 00:55:21,235
Those dying to banish me
will be avid to find you here

525
00:55:21,235 --> 00:55:21,736
So please

526
00:55:23,612 --> 00:55:27,241
Do not come for me again

527
00:55:28,492 --> 00:55:29,952
How can you be so cruel?

528
00:55:31,495 --> 00:55:36,000
Why do you think I endure
being on the throne? For what?

529
00:55:37,460 --> 00:55:39,253
Why put me in such misery?

530
00:55:41,839 --> 00:55:43,507
Yell at me instead

531
00:55:43,507 --> 00:55:49,638
For stealing my nephew's seat
and letting your father die!

532
00:55:49,638 --> 00:55:52,266
Say you are angry!
Say it!

533
00:56:02,485 --> 00:56:03,527
What is your name?

534
00:56:05,154 --> 00:56:06,655
It's Geum-ok, Your Majesty

535
00:56:08,032 --> 00:56:11,243
Why? Will you take her
to your chambers?

536
00:56:15,039 --> 00:56:16,248
Why not, madam

537
00:56:22,046 --> 00:56:24,507
Please don't do this!

538
00:56:25,549 --> 00:56:28,302
Don't let me go!
I don't want to!

539
00:56:28,302 --> 00:56:29,512
Let's go!

540
00:56:32,014 --> 00:56:33,808
Your Highness!

541
00:56:34,558 --> 00:56:41,941
Please! I don't want to go!

542
00:56:45,152 --> 00:56:47,947
Everything happened
as you wished

543
00:56:49,824 --> 00:56:52,201
Are you happy to get
your revenge!

544
00:56:55,955 --> 00:56:56,914
I thought

545
00:56:58,958 --> 00:57:01,085
you came into the palace
for me

546
00:57:05,798 --> 00:57:06,841
Now what?

547
00:57:09,593 --> 00:57:11,220
What do I do?

548
00:57:12,847 --> 00:57:13,973
If you want to live

549
00:57:15,599 --> 00:57:17,226
If you want to leave
the palace

550
00:57:19,103 --> 00:57:20,438
I shall find a way

551
00:57:22,189 --> 00:57:25,484
Why? Am I next?

552
00:57:26,235 --> 00:57:28,362
Do you know
where I just came from?

553
00:57:29,613 --> 00:57:33,242
I saw your father's head
hung in the street

554
00:58:02,146 --> 00:58:03,898
Does she resent me greatly?

555
00:58:06,901 --> 00:58:08,402
She is torn by the loss

556
00:58:10,404 --> 00:58:11,864
She cannot eat

557
00:58:13,491 --> 00:58:15,659
She is devastated

558
00:58:19,288 --> 00:58:20,414
Go on

559
00:58:22,041 --> 00:58:24,919
How does she look
before sleeping?

560
00:58:25,294 --> 00:58:26,003
Pardon?

561
00:58:28,005 --> 00:58:34,762
Well, she changes her clothes

562
00:58:39,016 --> 00:58:40,309
She unties her hair

563
00:58:44,063 --> 00:58:47,441
And sleeps in a white dress

564
00:58:49,193 --> 00:58:51,320
Who undresses her?

565
00:58:52,821 --> 00:58:54,198
I do, sire

566
00:58:55,824 --> 00:58:57,326
How do you undress her?

567
00:58:58,327 --> 00:59:04,458
Well, I untie the breast-tie

568
00:59:05,584 --> 00:59:09,088
- Do you bathe her, too?
- Yes, sire

569
00:59:09,547 --> 00:59:11,090
How do you bathe her?

570
00:59:11,090 --> 00:59:17,680
She goes into
a scented hot tub

571
00:59:17,846 --> 00:59:19,348
Where do you wash her first?

572
00:59:21,183 --> 00:59:27,231
With a fine cloth
I wash her breasts and shoulders

573
00:59:27,481 --> 00:59:30,234
Is she soft?

574
00:59:30,234 --> 00:59:34,446
Yes, she is so soft and white

575
00:59:34,446 --> 00:59:35,948
Go on

576
00:59:35,948 --> 00:59:39,868
When she gets up,
I wash between her legs

577
01:00:36,133 --> 01:00:37,134
Your Majesty

578
01:01:58,882 --> 01:02:00,384
This is your new room, madam

579
01:02:02,219 --> 01:02:06,724
You've gained His Majesty's favor,
but have yet to be a concubine

580
01:02:07,266 --> 01:02:11,395
Please mind your conduct and
do not wander from this room

581
01:02:12,646 --> 01:02:13,856
Yes, ma'am

582
01:02:18,110 --> 01:02:19,027
I see

583
01:02:22,656 --> 01:02:24,658
She will be your maid

584
01:02:25,534 --> 01:02:26,785
Madam

585
01:02:30,372 --> 01:02:32,291
Is there anything you need?

586
01:02:35,002 --> 01:02:38,797
- No. You may go
- Yes, ma'am

587
01:02:59,026 --> 01:03:00,194
Go away at once!

588
01:03:03,447 --> 01:03:04,323
Servants!

589
01:03:08,076 --> 01:03:13,165
Thank you, Your Majesty

590
01:03:17,461 --> 01:03:19,797
Oh, Your Majesty

591
01:04:27,656 --> 01:04:28,866
Geum-ok!

592
01:04:33,662 --> 01:04:35,122
Having fun, sir?

593
01:04:56,059 --> 01:04:57,644
What a strange world

594
01:04:59,021 --> 01:05:01,440
I became a royal concubine

595
01:05:02,566 --> 01:05:06,278
And you became a eunuch
Interesting, isn't it?

596
01:05:07,571 --> 01:05:09,323
His Majesty is here

597
01:05:14,286 --> 01:05:15,537
We're just in time

598
01:05:17,456 --> 01:05:19,458
They are not to be disturbed

599
01:05:23,295 --> 01:05:25,339
You became a senior eunuch?

600
01:05:27,591 --> 01:05:30,677
Will you help in His Majesty
coming to my court?

601
01:05:32,596 --> 01:05:35,223
Remember our ties
from outside the palace?

602
01:05:35,223 --> 01:05:38,810
I've forgotten all
that happened outside

603
01:05:40,687 --> 01:05:43,857
You must help me
to keep your secrets

604
01:05:45,609 --> 01:05:47,611
You've gone high enough

605
01:05:48,445 --> 01:05:52,866
Watch your tongue to avoid
bringing harm upon yourself

606
01:05:57,746 --> 01:05:59,247
Your Majesty

607
01:05:59,247 --> 01:06:05,003
How I upset you not knowing
the great pains I've caused

608
01:06:06,880 --> 01:06:07,965
No, madam

609
01:06:09,758 --> 01:06:15,138
I, too, have been upset over
what happened to your father

610
01:06:15,722 --> 01:06:22,896
What harm does the Queen Mother
think my son and I could be?

611
01:06:24,356 --> 01:06:25,399
Madam

612
01:06:36,660 --> 01:06:40,163
Forgive me about your father

613
01:06:45,293 --> 01:06:48,005
How could I blame you, sire?

614
01:06:49,297 --> 01:06:52,050
I must not be fit to be king

615
01:06:54,386 --> 01:06:56,430
What do you mean, sire?

616
01:06:58,515 --> 01:07:04,062
The late king always said
you had the wisdom and morals

617
01:07:06,815 --> 01:07:09,067
Why the Queen Mother's regency?

618
01:07:10,318 --> 01:07:14,698
What a shame and a pity

619
01:07:17,534 --> 01:07:21,329
It's time you gave orders
to depose them, Your Majesty

620
01:07:24,207 --> 01:07:29,463
Deposing her is not
the only way

621
01:07:30,047 --> 01:07:30,672
Pardon?

622
01:07:30,922 --> 01:07:36,470
Who would seek the truth
if she fell prey to a mishap?

623
01:07:38,055 --> 01:07:40,348
Don't mind her

624
01:07:40,348 --> 01:07:43,935
She's survived in the palace
for over 30 years

625
01:07:44,853 --> 01:07:47,355
Do you know why
she has but one ear?

626
01:07:49,816 --> 01:07:52,444
She heard something
she should not

627
01:07:59,743 --> 01:08:05,957
She is wise
She knows to go along with the tide

628
01:08:09,127 --> 01:08:11,129
He visited the former queen?

629
01:08:18,512 --> 01:08:22,307
Do you know anything
about poison?

630
01:08:24,101 --> 01:08:28,355
I once saw poisonous aconite
while with ginseng diggers

631
01:08:48,500 --> 01:08:51,461
- Having this inside the palace...
- Means trouble

632
01:08:52,212 --> 01:08:56,591
But to those who don't know,
it's just a rook

633
01:09:01,471 --> 01:09:04,099
Know how to make poison
with that?

634
01:09:05,350 --> 01:09:09,771
- By burning it, sir
- Then, make it

635
01:09:09,771 --> 01:09:17,237
If the mother and son won't leave,
there's only one way out of here

636
01:09:40,302 --> 01:09:42,429
You deal with where
His Majesty sleeps?

637
01:09:43,054 --> 01:09:44,514
Me?

638
01:09:46,057 --> 01:09:47,559
I wouldn't dare

639
01:09:48,018 --> 01:09:52,063
Could you lead him to me
on the 3rd?

640
01:09:52,689 --> 01:09:55,692
- Please, madam
- Who knows?

641
01:09:55,692 --> 01:09:58,695
If I give birth to a prince,
you'll be the chief eunuch

642
01:10:09,915 --> 01:10:13,919
No use for the libido
I get from eating frogs

643
01:10:14,336 --> 01:10:15,212
Excuse me

644
01:10:19,966 --> 01:10:23,720
30 years here, I can tell
why you came

645
01:10:23,720 --> 01:10:26,223
Let's see if you're fit
to bear a son

646
01:10:27,098 --> 01:10:30,060
Just examining
Don't get excited

647
01:10:35,232 --> 01:10:38,735
- I need something that works well
- Sure

648
01:10:41,738 --> 01:10:44,616
- Got different sized breasts?
- No!

649
01:10:44,616 --> 01:10:48,870
Your medicine depends on that
It'll be harder to have sons

650
01:10:50,247 --> 01:10:54,251
- They're different, right?
- No

651
01:10:54,251 --> 01:10:56,253
Let me take a look

652
01:10:59,089 --> 01:11:01,841
I'll have to feel them
to be sure

653
01:11:02,259 --> 01:11:04,511
They're the same!

654
01:11:04,511 --> 01:11:06,263
That's good

655
01:11:07,597 --> 01:11:09,641
This'll go in

656
01:11:10,100 --> 01:11:12,018
Is this for a son?

657
01:11:12,602 --> 01:11:16,523
Turn a girl into a boy
before birth

658
01:11:19,150 --> 01:11:21,903
Decoct it and drink it
the day before

659
01:11:21,903 --> 01:11:23,488
The day before

660
01:11:28,410 --> 01:11:29,286
Wait

661
01:11:30,537 --> 01:11:34,416
This is the son
She took the daughter

662
01:11:35,500 --> 01:11:37,377
People are so cunning

663
01:11:38,295 --> 01:11:41,923
When you go up,
you don't want to get down

664
01:11:43,133 --> 01:11:44,134
Right, Your Highness?

665
01:11:44,801 --> 01:11:48,888
With His Majesty's favor,
who says I can't become a queen?

666
01:11:48,888 --> 01:11:50,432
How dare you!

667
01:11:51,308 --> 01:11:52,892
Watch your words, madam

668
01:11:53,893 --> 01:11:56,688
You dare tell me what to do?

669
01:12:01,693 --> 01:12:04,696
With the king's favor
who would I help?

670
01:12:05,947 --> 01:12:08,074
Would I do anything
to harm you?

671
01:12:12,203 --> 01:12:17,334
Of course
How can I help?

672
01:12:17,334 --> 01:12:19,961
I should adorn myself
to catch his eye

673
01:12:21,338 --> 01:12:22,464
I need jewelry

674
01:12:23,423 --> 01:12:26,968
Take whatever you think
you'll need

675
01:12:42,233 --> 01:12:45,737
When you give birth
to a crown prince

676
01:12:47,238 --> 01:12:50,742
I'll build a temple somewhere
and pray there for life

677
01:12:51,201 --> 01:12:55,372
I'm ashamed for being unable
to give birth to a son

678
01:12:56,873 --> 01:13:04,881
His Majesty sent word he is in pain
and will not sleep here

679
01:13:07,759 --> 01:13:11,012
Does he know it's the most
auspicious day in 4 years?

680
01:13:11,513 --> 01:13:13,014
Yes, Your Majesty

681
01:13:18,144 --> 01:13:21,398
Let's go. My son is ill,
I must see him

682
01:13:24,401 --> 01:13:27,529
Have you learned
the traits of a king?

683
01:13:30,532 --> 01:13:33,159
It's okay. Tell me

684
01:13:34,911 --> 01:13:38,415
Yes, sire
It's wisdom, virtue, and honor

685
01:13:38,665 --> 01:13:39,541
Good

686
01:13:40,792 --> 01:13:43,044
What does wisdom mean?

687
01:13:43,044 --> 01:13:47,298
It means having
open eyes and ears

688
01:13:47,298 --> 01:13:52,429
The eyes must foresee things

689
01:13:52,429 --> 01:13:58,184
The ears must listen
to the people

690
01:13:58,393 --> 01:14:00,061
Good

691
01:14:00,061 --> 01:14:01,438
That is correct

692
01:14:02,439 --> 01:14:03,690
Here

693
01:14:05,442 --> 01:14:08,194
Sire? The decoction
is getting cold

694
01:14:10,071 --> 01:14:14,451
I must be nothing more than
a breeding pig

695
01:14:15,660 --> 01:14:18,079
Of course not, sire

696
01:14:18,580 --> 01:14:21,958
How can having an heir
be taken lightly?

697
01:14:22,333 --> 01:14:24,961
Quiet! You drink it

698
01:14:27,589 --> 01:14:30,842
It would've been better
if you were king

699
01:14:30,842 --> 01:14:33,803
Sire. The Queen Mother
has arrived

700
01:14:56,242 --> 01:14:57,952
What are you doing!

701
01:14:58,995 --> 01:15:03,333
I am not only your son,
but the king

702
01:15:05,210 --> 01:15:09,005
What king? When you don't come
to the assemblies!

703
01:15:09,005 --> 01:15:12,008
You don't give me a chance
to do anything

704
01:15:12,717 --> 01:15:15,637
You make all the decisions

705
01:15:15,637 --> 01:15:18,264
Now, you want me to be
a puppet?

706
01:15:20,099 --> 01:15:24,354
When things settle and you have
an heir, I will step down

707
01:15:24,354 --> 01:15:25,730
When will that be?

708
01:15:28,149 --> 01:15:29,275
What?

709
01:15:29,609 --> 01:15:32,529
Why don't you just sit
on the throne, Mother?

710
01:15:33,905 --> 01:15:37,492
I am sick of sleeping with
the queen before you!

711
01:15:37,909 --> 01:15:41,746
I just have to sow the seeds?

712
01:15:42,789 --> 01:15:45,166
It doesn't have to be the queen

713
01:15:46,793 --> 01:15:48,419
An auspicious day?

714
01:15:49,921 --> 01:15:51,548
I'll give the concubines
a chance!

715
01:15:52,423 --> 01:15:53,675
Who is it?

716
01:15:53,675 --> 01:15:55,760
It's Lady Geum-ok, sire

717
01:15:56,177 --> 01:15:57,011
Let's go

718
01:16:09,649 --> 01:16:10,567
Why you!

719
01:16:14,445 --> 01:16:15,196
Your Majesty

720
01:16:18,408 --> 01:16:20,076
Why do you have this?

721
01:16:20,827 --> 01:16:24,163
Your Majesty, please...

722
01:16:24,581 --> 01:16:26,833
Tell me why you have this!

723
01:16:26,833 --> 01:16:30,962
Sire! I can explain...

724
01:16:32,547 --> 01:16:33,423
Your Majesty!

725
01:16:35,842 --> 01:16:37,677
I have something
to say, sire

726
01:16:44,225 --> 01:16:47,228
There's something
you must know

727
01:16:55,862 --> 01:16:57,989
Why was this
in someone else's hand?

728
01:17:00,116 --> 01:17:03,077
Please calm your anger
and have a seat, sire

729
01:17:03,077 --> 01:17:04,954
Don't you know how I feel?

730
01:17:07,457 --> 01:17:09,334
Do you detest me that much?

731
01:17:11,753 --> 01:17:12,503
Am I...

732
01:17:14,255 --> 01:17:17,133
no better than that eunuch?

733
01:17:20,136 --> 01:17:21,137
Drag him in

734
01:17:25,391 --> 01:17:27,018
He seemed familiar

735
01:17:28,019 --> 01:17:30,772
He was the fool who lived
in your house!

736
01:17:31,272 --> 01:17:33,524
You disguised him as a eunuch?

737
01:17:34,150 --> 01:17:36,903
- That's preposterous
- Explain yourself!

738
01:17:37,278 --> 01:17:39,113
Why is that fool here!

739
01:17:39,906 --> 01:17:46,162
I didn't know he was here
until recently, Your Majesty

740
01:17:46,162 --> 01:17:48,539
You expect me to believe that?

741
01:17:51,417 --> 01:17:54,921
I remember how he used to
look at you!

742
01:17:56,005 --> 01:17:57,799
You and that fool!

743
01:18:03,805 --> 01:18:06,891
Who's the father of
your prematurely born son?

744
01:18:08,059 --> 01:18:10,269
Is he my brother's son or not?

745
01:18:12,021 --> 01:18:13,147
Undress him

746
01:18:14,190 --> 01:18:16,693
I must see if he is
a eunuch or not!

747
01:18:16,693 --> 01:18:19,946
Must you humiliate me
like this?

748
01:18:20,446 --> 01:18:21,322
Strip him!

749
01:18:22,657 --> 01:18:25,827
Sire. Why would you see
something so hideous?

750
01:18:56,482 --> 01:18:59,318
Please leave, sire

751
01:19:08,244 --> 01:19:08,870
Madam!

752
01:19:09,579 --> 01:19:11,330
Don't you know how I feel?

753
01:19:12,498 --> 01:19:15,001
Do you really think
I don't know?

754
01:19:19,505 --> 01:19:23,384
When the Queen Mother
watches so viciously...

755
01:19:25,386 --> 01:19:28,389
Queen Mother or not,
I don't know care!

756
01:19:30,600 --> 01:19:35,646
Look at me. I'm a wreck
I want you so!

757
01:19:52,622 --> 01:19:53,164
Sire

758
01:20:00,922 --> 01:20:01,547
Sire!

759
01:20:04,509 --> 01:20:05,301
Sire!

760
01:20:13,768 --> 01:20:18,648
When you become a true king,
please return then

761
01:20:27,156 --> 01:20:28,324
I shall become a king

762
01:20:29,575 --> 01:20:32,286
I shall become a true king

763
01:20:40,086 --> 01:20:43,172
He broke family morals and...

764
01:20:46,926 --> 01:20:48,845
No one must know of this

765
01:20:50,221 --> 01:20:51,180
Yes, Your Majesty

766
01:20:51,973 --> 01:20:54,225
You know very well, sir

767
01:20:56,853 --> 01:21:01,190
What I had to do
to seat him on the throne

768
01:21:03,234 --> 01:21:04,443
Get rid of her

769
01:21:26,090 --> 01:21:29,385
Why didn't you tell me?

770
01:21:30,970 --> 01:21:35,141
What would change
by telling you?

771
01:21:37,768 --> 01:21:42,148
If you only told me...

772
01:21:53,868 --> 01:21:54,911
Let's run

773
01:21:56,913 --> 01:21:57,788
Then what?

774
01:22:00,374 --> 01:22:02,627
We tried that once

775
01:22:10,801 --> 01:22:18,309
Rather than living like this,
let's all leave together

776
01:22:20,019 --> 01:22:22,772
Going outside the palace
means death for us

777
01:22:24,774 --> 01:22:26,776
I won't endanger my son

778
01:22:26,776 --> 01:22:31,322
No matter what,
he's the late king's prince

779
01:22:32,406 --> 01:22:34,075
He'll die because of that

780
01:22:34,075 --> 01:22:34,825
No

781
01:22:37,453 --> 01:22:42,083
I'll protect him
no matter what

782
01:22:51,842 --> 01:22:52,593
Then

783
01:22:55,846 --> 01:22:57,098
How can I help?

784
01:23:00,726 --> 01:23:05,731
What do you want me to do?

785
01:23:16,242 --> 01:23:17,201
Hwayeon

786
01:23:20,496 --> 01:23:21,580
Sire

787
01:23:21,580 --> 01:23:25,084
You shot 40 times
Think of...

788
01:23:31,257 --> 01:23:33,009
You called, Your Majesty?

789
01:23:41,267 --> 01:23:42,018
Shoot!

790
01:23:42,768 --> 01:23:44,228
Let's see how good you are

791
01:23:45,146 --> 01:23:47,356
I dare not hold
His Majesty's bow

792
01:23:47,857 --> 01:23:48,983
Give him a bow

793
01:24:00,494 --> 01:24:01,037
Kwonyoo

794
01:24:05,416 --> 01:24:08,044
Why'd you come
into the palace?

795
01:24:09,045 --> 01:24:13,049
Becoming a court eunuch
was the only way I had, sire

796
01:24:15,676 --> 01:24:18,304
A eunuch dare loved the queen?

797
01:24:19,388 --> 01:24:21,682
Of course not, sire

798
01:24:24,393 --> 01:24:26,062
I must see the former queen

799
01:24:27,313 --> 01:24:31,567
I acted disrespectfully last night,
so I must see her

800
01:24:33,152 --> 01:24:38,407
The Queen Mother is sick in bed
Will you visit her first?

801
01:24:55,549 --> 01:24:58,344
He still suspects it

802
01:25:03,808 --> 01:25:05,851
We can't keep staying here

803
01:25:18,447 --> 01:25:20,366
Sire, please...

804
01:25:24,703 --> 01:25:25,246
Sire!

805
01:25:36,465 --> 01:25:38,092
What is it, sire?

806
01:25:49,395 --> 01:25:50,396
Sire

807
01:25:55,359 --> 01:25:58,154
Kwonyoo? Where is he?

808
01:25:59,405 --> 01:26:01,740
Call Choongyoung

809
01:27:11,810 --> 01:27:13,604
I'm not drinking
that decoction again

810
01:27:13,604 --> 01:27:15,564
But, Your Majesty

811
01:27:15,564 --> 01:27:20,986
The Queen Mother makes sure
you drink this every day

812
01:27:21,237 --> 01:27:22,613
Then, you drink it

813
01:27:23,322 --> 01:27:24,698
Pardon?

814
01:27:25,366 --> 01:27:32,748
But we don't even eat garlic
to curb our libido, sire

815
01:27:36,877 --> 01:27:38,712
Eunuchs have sexual drive?

816
01:27:40,089 --> 01:27:47,471
We can't have erections
but still feel sexual desires, sire

817
01:27:51,225 --> 01:27:51,892
Choongyoung

818
01:27:53,269 --> 01:27:54,520
You drink it

819
01:27:57,273 --> 01:27:59,525
Why? You can't?

820
01:28:00,276 --> 01:28:02,152
Afraid to be sexually aroused?

821
01:28:03,904 --> 01:28:04,738
Drink it

822
01:28:32,933 --> 01:28:34,810
I won't endanger my son

823
01:28:36,437 --> 01:28:39,565
I'll protect him
no matter what

824
01:28:56,915 --> 01:29:00,044
No worries
Yours is completely gone

825
01:29:06,842 --> 01:29:09,345
No!

826
01:29:11,096 --> 01:29:12,181
It can't be!

827
01:29:16,685 --> 01:29:17,686
Who is it?

828
01:29:20,189 --> 01:29:21,482
Who ordered this?

829
01:29:21,482 --> 01:29:22,858
Please calm down, sire

830
01:29:23,609 --> 01:29:26,320
I do not know anything, sire

831
01:29:26,987 --> 01:29:29,865
I just got the medicine
and decocted it as usual

832
01:29:32,701 --> 01:29:34,370
Your Majesty...

833
01:29:38,749 --> 01:29:42,836
Anyone who speaks of this
shall be beheaded!

834
01:29:43,754 --> 01:29:45,464
Call the physician in secret

835
01:29:48,592 --> 01:29:52,638
Save him
I have something to hear from him

836
01:29:58,894 --> 01:30:01,146
Forgive me, sire!

837
01:30:01,522 --> 01:30:04,733
I do not know anything

838
01:30:04,733 --> 01:30:05,776
Show the evidence

839
01:30:07,361 --> 01:30:09,029
Do you recognize it?

840
01:30:09,279 --> 01:30:11,532
It was found in your room

841
01:30:12,408 --> 01:30:15,411
I really don't know, sire

842
01:30:18,122 --> 01:30:18,872
Why?

843
01:30:19,790 --> 01:30:21,792
Did the Queen Mother say
to kill me?

844
01:30:21,792 --> 01:30:23,919
Of course not, sire

845
01:30:23,919 --> 01:30:28,924
Then, who is in charge of
the medicinal herbs?

846
01:30:30,300 --> 01:30:33,053
It's Minister Yoon, sire

847
01:30:42,563 --> 01:30:44,314
No one is allowed in, sir

848
01:30:49,820 --> 01:30:50,529
Look

849
01:30:51,447 --> 01:30:52,281
Wake up!

850
01:30:53,282 --> 01:30:56,952
Pil-woon, wake up

851
01:30:57,202 --> 01:31:00,706
Water...

852
01:31:03,459 --> 01:31:04,460
Here

853
01:31:07,963 --> 01:31:10,090
More

854
01:31:20,684 --> 01:31:22,227
Are you okay?

855
01:31:22,811 --> 01:31:25,105
I'm a sore sight, aren't I?

856
01:31:26,356 --> 01:31:28,484
I must look awful

857
01:31:30,068 --> 01:31:32,863
You don't look too bad

858
01:31:34,490 --> 01:31:37,868
He gave Minister Yoon's name

859
01:31:38,869 --> 01:31:42,498
Terror will soon strike
the palace

860
01:31:45,501 --> 01:31:47,628
Send me along before then?

861
01:31:48,378 --> 01:31:52,341
What do you mean?

862
01:31:53,342 --> 01:31:56,887
You know very well
what power is

863
01:31:58,472 --> 01:32:02,976
His Majesty must want something
out of this

864
01:32:04,353 --> 01:32:07,898
Though living in dung
is better than dying

865
01:32:11,527 --> 01:32:13,779
I don't want to go on

866
01:32:17,032 --> 01:32:17,783
Please?

867
01:32:19,409 --> 01:32:20,786
I can't!

868
01:32:22,120 --> 01:32:27,793
What if the king
wants your name?

869
01:32:34,258 --> 01:32:35,259
What are you doing?

870
01:32:37,553 --> 01:32:40,681
I'll get you out of the palace

871
01:32:40,681 --> 01:32:45,018
It's no use. I'm exhausted

872
01:32:45,018 --> 01:32:47,020
I'll see to everything!

873
01:32:55,320 --> 01:32:56,446
Look...

874
01:32:58,073 --> 01:33:00,576
Thanks for your company

875
01:33:01,702 --> 01:33:03,579
Sorry to go first

876
01:33:03,954 --> 01:33:05,581
Put that down!

877
01:33:07,165 --> 01:33:09,835
No!

878
01:33:10,836 --> 01:33:12,838
Wake up!

879
01:33:14,089 --> 01:33:16,341
Pil-woon! No!

880
01:33:19,177 --> 01:33:21,221
Go in peace, my friend

881
01:33:23,557 --> 01:33:27,978
Don't stop by here and there

882
01:33:30,230 --> 01:33:38,697
Just look at the white light
and go straight there

883
01:33:46,830 --> 01:33:47,623
I promise

884
01:33:48,707 --> 01:33:51,126
I'll bring the prince
back safely

885
01:33:52,628 --> 01:33:56,381
We'll soon meet again
Don't fret, Your Highness

886
01:34:01,511 --> 01:34:04,139
Mother! I don't want to go!

887
01:34:05,015 --> 01:34:08,644
Mother!

888
01:34:13,774 --> 01:34:15,984
That is nothing but the truth?

889
01:34:15,984 --> 01:34:18,904
I wouldn't dare lie
to you, Your Majesty

890
01:34:21,031 --> 01:34:24,785
She deceived a eunuch's child
for the king's son?

891
01:34:26,620 --> 01:34:29,539
And became a queen?

892
01:34:33,126 --> 01:34:34,544
Wretched whore!

893
01:34:36,797 --> 01:34:37,923
Come in!

894
01:34:41,551 --> 01:34:42,678
Yes, Your Majesty

895
01:34:43,303 --> 01:34:44,638
Send her to the dungeon

896
01:34:53,063 --> 01:34:54,815
Me?

897
01:34:58,568 --> 01:34:59,403
Your Majesty!

898
01:35:00,696 --> 01:35:06,827
I'll go back to being a maid!
Please, not the dungeon!

899
01:35:08,412 --> 01:35:10,706
I'd rather die than go there!

900
01:35:12,457 --> 01:35:13,083
Kill her

901
01:35:13,959 --> 01:35:19,172
But, Your Majesty! No!

902
01:35:19,840 --> 01:35:21,842
Let me go!

903
01:35:22,217 --> 01:35:23,927
Why are you doing this to me?

904
01:35:23,927 --> 01:35:28,724
Please save me, Your Majesty!

905
01:35:29,933 --> 01:35:32,436
Let go! No!

906
01:35:32,936 --> 01:35:36,356
Your Majesty!

907
01:35:39,443 --> 01:35:41,194
I don't want to die!

908
01:35:42,446 --> 01:35:43,864
There is more!

909
01:35:50,245 --> 01:35:55,000
The Queen Mother sent strict
orders to escort you

910
01:35:59,212 --> 01:36:01,631
Minister Yoon!
The king has charged you!

911
01:36:10,140 --> 01:36:13,769
Fool! How dare you come
here like that?

912
01:36:13,769 --> 01:36:14,895
What's going on?

913
01:36:15,771 --> 01:36:18,732
Minister Yoon is charged
with treason

914
01:36:19,649 --> 01:36:20,901
Treason?

915
01:36:22,152 --> 01:36:23,904
Go away at once!

916
01:36:24,404 --> 01:36:28,033
I apologize, but the king ordered
to imprison him at once

917
01:36:29,743 --> 01:36:30,660
The king's order?

918
01:36:35,665 --> 01:36:37,918
Who put you in that position?

919
01:36:39,419 --> 01:36:40,879
You dare raise your sword?

920
01:36:42,881 --> 01:36:46,176
You dare raise a sword at me?

921
01:36:51,306 --> 01:36:56,019
I'll go to the king
Go to the dungeon and kill her!

922
01:37:02,442 --> 01:37:06,071
The chief eunuch
has arrived, sire

923
01:37:31,179 --> 01:37:32,097
Sire!

924
01:37:35,225 --> 01:37:36,476
Where are you?

925
01:37:37,686 --> 01:37:39,062
I know you are here!

926
01:37:40,689 --> 01:37:41,982
Come out here!

927
01:37:43,608 --> 01:37:45,360
Sitting up here

928
01:37:48,196 --> 01:37:51,741
I can see why you were
so attached to it

929
01:37:51,741 --> 01:37:53,243
What are you doing there?

930
01:37:55,370 --> 01:37:58,081
Why did you order
Minister Yoon's arrest?

931
01:38:02,252 --> 01:38:04,504
You sent away
the soldiers I sent?

932
01:38:05,338 --> 01:38:08,133
How can you send soldiers
to your mother?

933
01:38:09,092 --> 01:38:12,762
I must really be a puppet king

934
01:38:14,764 --> 01:38:22,772
You liked that seat so much,
you cut me up into a puppet

935
01:38:24,524 --> 01:38:26,484
Now, you'll get rid of me?

936
01:38:27,027 --> 01:38:28,403
What do you mean?

937
01:38:33,283 --> 01:38:35,660
Did you give the order
to poison me?

938
01:38:37,037 --> 01:38:37,871
What?

939
01:38:39,664 --> 01:38:41,374
The physician confessed

940
01:38:43,251 --> 01:38:46,296
You plotted with Yoon
to kill me?

941
01:38:48,048 --> 01:38:48,673
What?

942
01:38:50,050 --> 01:38:52,427
- That's preposterous!
- Isn't it?

943
01:38:54,179 --> 01:38:55,931
I thought it was strange

944
01:38:57,807 --> 01:39:02,187
Your man, Yoon, couldn't have
plotted this alone!

945
01:39:04,272 --> 01:39:05,565
This is a trap!

946
01:39:09,069 --> 01:39:12,572
The former queen is up to this
That wretch!

947
01:39:12,572 --> 01:39:19,204
Right. Now, I see

948
01:39:21,581 --> 01:39:25,961
Poison the decoction
than frame her?

949
01:39:29,214 --> 01:39:33,718
Kill me, her, and my nephew?

950
01:39:37,347 --> 01:39:40,058
Then, who did you plan
to seat here?

951
01:39:40,725 --> 01:39:42,060
What do you mean?

952
01:39:44,479 --> 01:39:48,692
Minister Yoon and I lived
to out you on that throne!

953
01:39:52,320 --> 01:39:55,615
You lasted quite long

954
01:39:58,118 --> 01:40:00,120
- Kill her!
- Yes, sir!

955
01:40:09,504 --> 01:40:11,256
- Who are you!
- Charge!

956
01:40:21,766 --> 01:40:22,642
Kill them!

957
01:40:30,358 --> 01:40:34,404
Seize everyone one of
the traitors!

958
01:40:34,404 --> 01:40:35,864
Traitors!

959
01:40:59,387 --> 01:41:02,015
Do you know what she did?

960
01:41:03,183 --> 01:41:05,560
The late king couldn't
have children

961
01:41:05,560 --> 01:41:07,937
Be honest for once!

962
01:41:12,067 --> 01:41:14,569
Have you forgotten?

963
01:41:14,569 --> 01:41:17,072
The late queen died
while giving birth!

964
01:41:20,200 --> 01:41:21,826
I poisoned him since

965
01:41:23,828 --> 01:41:27,540
- The prince's birth is dubious
- What?

966
01:41:30,168 --> 01:41:34,047
You poisoned my brother?

967
01:41:43,848 --> 01:41:45,725
Who asked you to do that?

968
01:41:46,684 --> 01:41:47,977
For whom!

969
01:41:50,188 --> 01:41:52,607
For whom did you do that!

970
01:41:55,860 --> 01:41:59,739
When did I ever say
I wanted to be king?

971
01:42:01,116 --> 01:42:04,119
When did I ever say
I wanted to be king!

972
01:42:08,748 --> 01:42:09,582
My child...

973
01:42:10,500 --> 01:42:11,459
Look at me

974
01:42:19,259 --> 01:42:22,887
It was all to protect you
in this cruel palace

975
01:42:24,222 --> 01:42:26,266
I'm your mother

976
01:42:32,397 --> 01:42:34,649
Why'd you force me
on the throne

977
01:42:37,277 --> 01:42:40,405
and turn me into someone
who can't trust his mother?

978
01:42:41,239 --> 01:42:43,408
You can't trust me?

979
01:42:51,040 --> 01:42:54,544
You dare defy your mother!

980
01:42:59,924 --> 01:43:03,678
If you all meet,
the truth will come out

981
01:43:05,054 --> 01:43:06,306
Guards!

982
01:43:08,183 --> 01:43:12,187
Bring Minister Yoon
and Kwonyoo at once!

983
01:43:12,562 --> 01:43:13,938
That won't happen!

984
01:43:13,938 --> 01:43:15,690
Yes, it will!

985
01:43:21,070 --> 01:43:21,821
Minister Yoon!

986
01:43:33,791 --> 01:43:38,588
I brought the criminals
as ordered, Your Majesty

987
01:43:42,300 --> 01:43:43,843
The physician confessed

988
01:43:45,720 --> 01:43:47,680
Evidence was found in his room

989
01:43:48,556 --> 01:43:51,059
Who do you think he said
was behind this?

990
01:43:51,059 --> 01:43:54,979
How would I know, sire?

991
01:43:54,979 --> 01:43:56,689
Why can't you say it!

992
01:43:57,482 --> 01:44:00,610
I do not know anything

993
01:44:00,610 --> 01:44:04,572
I drank the decoction,
did I not?

994
01:44:04,572 --> 01:44:08,493
Then, Why'd you hesitate
when I told you to drink it!

995
01:44:09,744 --> 01:44:11,746
You knew it was poisoned,
didn't you!

996
01:44:11,746 --> 01:44:13,623
Enough! Stop it!

997
01:44:13,623 --> 01:44:16,709
I'm asking this fool
a question!

998
01:44:18,878 --> 01:44:21,631
You knew!

999
01:44:21,631 --> 01:44:23,508
How'd you know
it was poisoned?

1000
01:44:24,592 --> 01:44:25,218
Sire!

1001
01:44:25,760 --> 01:44:27,720
Do you know what she did?

1002
01:44:29,639 --> 01:44:34,978
She defiled the royal court
with that fool!

1003
01:44:36,104 --> 01:44:38,356
Drag her here to confess!

1004
01:44:39,524 --> 01:44:40,525
Yes!

1005
01:44:42,277 --> 01:44:43,987
I'm guilty

1006
01:44:44,779 --> 01:44:47,407
Guilty for bearing
the late king's son

1007
01:44:48,616 --> 01:44:50,660
And guilty for being alive

1008
01:44:50,660 --> 01:44:54,789
You're guilty for this uproar
due to your son

1009
01:44:55,999 --> 01:44:58,626
And guilty for distracting
the king!

1010
01:45:01,629 --> 01:45:02,672
But, Your Majesty

1011
01:45:03,923 --> 01:45:05,383
Who is that man?

1012
01:45:07,010 --> 01:45:11,306
He's Minister Yoon's man
who killed my father

1013
01:45:12,307 --> 01:45:18,146
What daughter would secretly
plot with the enemy?

1014
01:45:18,146 --> 01:45:18,813
You wretch!

1015
01:45:19,814 --> 01:45:22,775
How dare you show
fake tears here!

1016
01:45:23,318 --> 01:45:26,070
What would my young child
know or do

1017
01:45:26,904 --> 01:45:29,449
that I'd covet your throne?

1018
01:45:30,325 --> 01:45:32,160
If I thought that
in the slightest

1019
01:45:33,953 --> 01:45:37,332
I'd bite my tongue
and die right here

1020
01:45:38,708 --> 01:45:43,463
But I cannot die falsely accused
as someone so shameless

1021
01:45:48,926 --> 01:45:50,845
Confess the truth!

1022
01:45:50,845 --> 01:45:53,473
Who ordered you to poison
the decoction?

1023
01:46:09,822 --> 01:46:11,324
The Queen Mother

1024
01:46:13,076 --> 01:46:17,121
She ordered me to make
the poison

1025
01:46:18,206 --> 01:46:22,251
And Minister Yoon gave it to...

1026
01:46:22,251 --> 01:46:23,336
This is a trap!

1027
01:46:23,336 --> 01:46:24,253
It's a trap, sire!

1028
01:46:29,592 --> 01:46:30,718
What are you doing?

1029
01:46:33,262 --> 01:46:35,264
Why did you do it!

1030
01:46:35,890 --> 01:46:41,145
Was the throne that dear
to kill your own son?

1031
01:46:41,145 --> 01:46:42,522
Tell me!

1032
01:46:43,272 --> 01:46:45,358
Calm down, sire!

1033
01:46:45,358 --> 01:46:47,735
She can't breathe! Sire!

1034
01:46:55,410 --> 01:47:00,540
Lock them up
and execute them all!

1035
01:47:02,875 --> 01:47:05,920
Escort the Queen Mother
to remain in her quarters

1036
01:47:05,920 --> 01:47:14,053
Anyone who dares contact her
shall be gravely punished!

1037
01:47:15,555 --> 01:47:18,182
Your Majesty! No!

1038
01:47:29,318 --> 01:47:31,404
Thank you for keeping
your promise

1039
01:47:32,447 --> 01:47:35,324
I shall never forget this

1040
01:47:40,413 --> 01:47:43,916
Our son...Protect him well

1041
01:47:50,173 --> 01:47:51,215
Our son?

1042
01:47:53,426 --> 01:47:56,304
The prince is no one's son

1043
01:47:57,972 --> 01:47:59,098
He is my son

1044
01:48:55,488 --> 01:49:00,284
When you become a true king,
please return then

1045
01:49:25,393 --> 01:49:26,686
Is it all done?

1046
01:49:28,521 --> 01:49:31,315
Will you accept me now?

1047
01:55:45,064 --> 01:55:48,067
Farewell, My King!

1048
01:55:50,069 --> 01:55:53,697
Farewell, My King!

1049
01:55:55,449 --> 01:55:58,827
Farewell, My King!

1050
01:56:00,704 --> 01:56:05,209
Open your ears to hear
the people

1051
01:56:07,086 --> 01:56:11,215
Calm thy heart first
for the affairs of the nation

1052
01:56:13,926 --> 01:56:15,469
Understood?

1053
01:56:16,971 --> 01:56:17,930
Your Highness?

1054
01:56:23,435 --> 01:56:25,104
At last, it happened?

1055
01:56:27,690 --> 01:56:29,483
I am very sorry

1056
01:56:32,695 --> 01:56:36,991
So, you came for me?

1057
01:56:43,247 --> 01:56:44,623
Do me a favor
