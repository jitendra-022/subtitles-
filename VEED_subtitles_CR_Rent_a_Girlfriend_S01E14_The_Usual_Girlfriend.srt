286
00:14:53,470 --> 00:14:55,040
To get some fresh water.

287
00:14:57,790 --> 00:15:00,320
Uh-oh, we're all alone now.

288
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,740
Okay, she's gone.

289
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,380
Kazuya-kun.

290
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:10,010
I have a favor to ask of you.

291
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:14,580
A favor?

292
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:17,940
What is it?

293
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:27,230
What's all this about?

294
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:29,550
Did she find out we were lying?

295
00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:33,540
No way. We didn't slip up... I think.

296
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:37,040
Wait, she's Mizuhara's grandma.

297
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:40,340
She might be terrifyingly perceptive.

298
00:15:42,370 --> 00:15:46,710
Oh, right. I heard you went \Nto see Chizuru's play.

299
00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:50,090
Yeah, I did.

300
00:15:50,090 --> 00:15:53,390
How was it? I couldn't make it, you see.

301
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,480
It was amazing!

302
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:04,010
She was shining up there...

303
00:16:04,010 --> 00:16:06,890
Completely unlike the usual Chizuru-san.

304
00:16:06,890 --> 00:16:09,060
She was really so damn cool!

305
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:11,610
Did you tell her that?

306
00:16:11,610 --> 00:16:14,570
Huh? Yeah, I told her.

307
00:16:15,530 --> 00:16:18,660
More like, I went and ran my big mouth.

308
00:16:19,290 --> 00:16:21,670
It must've made her so happy.

309
00:16:22,450 --> 00:16:27,280
She's always loved acting and compliments, \Never since she was a child.

310
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:29,460
Oh, I didn't know.

311
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:34,050
Chizuru-san is truly incredible.

312
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:36,740
She's got her act together, \Nand she's so strong.

313
00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:40,340
Meanwhile, all I ever am is a burden...

314
00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:48,110
"Strong"? Who, Chizuru?

315
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:55,080
She's always been a needy girl.

316
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,910
Her? No way!

317
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:02,920
The older kids in the neighborhood \Nwould often make her cry,

318
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:06,890
and she'd crawl into my bed, \Nsaying she felt all alone.

319
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:08,730
That's the kind of little girl she was.

320
00:17:10,819 --> 00:17:12,619
Needy...

321
00:17:12,619 --> 00:17:14,010
Mizuhara?

322
00:17:14,869 --> 00:17:16,650

323
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:21,040

What makes humans special is that, \Nthough we may be hurt by how weak we are,

358
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:51,520
we can admit that others can \Nbe amazing and admire them.

You've already made it big.

361

Chizuru's a little awkward in recognizing \Nand accepting her weakness.

362
00:19:07,290 --> 00:19:13,920
She's covering her fragile self in armor \Nof ice—a mere display of strength.

363
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:17,300
In that sense, she's a prodigious actress.

Mizuhara is her dear granddaughter.

373

She would never want her \Nto date some random dude.
