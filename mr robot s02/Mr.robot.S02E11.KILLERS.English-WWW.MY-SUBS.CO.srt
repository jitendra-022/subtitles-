1
00:00:00,047 --> 00:00:02,007
Alexa, when is the end of the world?

2
00:00:02,063 --> 00:00:04,928
<i>Unless a future technology
goes very wrong indeed,</i>

3
00:00:04,953 --> 00:00:06,452
<i>Earth is most likely to be destroyed</i>

4
00:00:06,487 --> 00:00:08,350
<i>in several billion years' time.</i>

5
00:00:08,375 --> 00:00:10,041
The president can't go to Congress

6
00:00:10,076 --> 00:00:11,296
with a bailout right now.

7
00:00:11,321 --> 00:00:14,289
I could see a scenario where
the Chinese government

8
00:00:14,436 --> 00:00:16,804
loans E Corp the money it needs

9
00:00:16,829 --> 00:00:18,362
at a low interest rate,

10
00:00:18,548 --> 00:00:19,781
<i>perhaps even zero.</i>

11
00:00:19,886 --> 00:00:23,287
_

12
00:00:23,323 --> 00:00:25,223
You want me to convince the class

13
00:00:25,248 --> 00:00:26,914
to remove the contingency.

14
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:29,060
<i>Your little pet project</i>

15
00:00:29,095 --> 00:00:30,862
<i>came through even better
than you thought.</i>

16
00:00:30,897 --> 00:00:33,531
You do work at E Corp. Yes?

17
00:00:33,566 --> 00:00:35,033
What is your position there?

18
00:00:35,068 --> 00:00:35,812
I never said that.

19
00:00:35,945 --> 00:00:37,277
I'm gonna confess.

20
00:00:37,313 --> 00:00:38,879
I've already called my lawyer.

21
00:00:38,914 --> 00:00:40,214
We can't beat them.

22
00:00:40,249 --> 00:00:41,582
No matter what we do,

23
00:00:41,617 --> 00:00:44,518
we will always lose to them.

24
00:00:44,553 --> 00:00:46,386
Next person's not gonna offer you food.

25
00:00:46,422 --> 00:00:47,788
<i>They're gonna grab you off the street</i>

26
00:00:47,823 --> 00:00:49,723
<i>and throw you in a dark cell.</i>

27
00:00:49,758 --> 00:00:51,024
<i>I've tried to have him tracked,</i>

28
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:52,359
<i>but I've been unsuccessful.</i>

29
00:00:52,394 --> 00:00:53,394
- Got it.
- Is that where

30
00:00:53,429 --> 00:00:54,561
the phone is right now?

31
00:00:54,597 --> 00:00:56,463
Okay, okay.

32
00:00:56,498 --> 00:00:58,398
We're gonna settle down here.

33
00:00:58,434 --> 00:00:59,733
Hey, Elliot.

34
00:00:59,768 --> 00:01:00,768
You can stay here

35
00:01:00,769 --> 00:01:02,035
and crash on the couch.

36
00:01:02,071 --> 00:01:03,403
Home would be better.

37
00:01:03,439 --> 00:01:05,105
<i>Is Mr. Robot MIA</i>

38
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:07,374
<i>because he's afraid
of what I might find?</i>

39
00:01:07,409 --> 00:01:09,776
<i>Send all units to Watts and 6th Ave.</i>

40
00:01:16,285 --> 00:01:19,119
<i>Angela's right. We can't beat them.</i>

41
00:01:19,154 --> 00:01:21,788
<i>But we don't have to
lose to them either.</i>

42
00:01:21,824 --> 00:01:26,159
<i>Maybe there's a way to
stop them from winning.</i>

43
00:01:26,195 --> 00:01:31,265
<i>Mr. Robot, the ever-present
silent observer,</i>

44
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:33,767
<i>watching me at all times,</i>

45
00:01:33,802 --> 00:01:36,136
<i>even when I can't see him,</i>

46
00:01:36,171 --> 00:01:39,273
<i>listening in on our conversations.</i>

47
00:01:39,308 --> 00:01:41,508
<i>He's always a step ahead of me,</i>

48
00:01:41,543 --> 00:01:43,810
<i>'cause he is me.</i>

49
00:01:43,846 --> 00:01:45,946
<i>Maybe he's the key to this.</i>

50
00:01:45,981 --> 00:01:48,448
<i>Maybe he's always been the key to this.</i>

51
00:01:48,484 --> 00:01:50,918
<i>What if I could be the silent observer?</i>

52
00:01:53,122 --> 00:01:56,156
<i>In middle school, I took
a Visual Basic class.</i>

53
00:01:56,191 --> 00:01:59,092
<i>I remember my friend Sam
telling me about a technique</i>

54
00:01:59,128 --> 00:02:04,131
<i>he used to induce lucid dreams
so he could study in his sleep.</i>

55
00:02:04,166 --> 00:02:08,035
<i>You lie in bed and repeat
this mantra in your head:</i>

56
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:11,638
<i>Mind awake. Body asleep.</i>

57
00:02:11,674 --> 00:02:14,808
<i>Mind awake. Body asleep.</i>

58
00:02:14,843 --> 00:02:16,610
<i>You're in this with me,</i>

59
00:02:16,645 --> 00:02:19,513
<i>so it'll work better
if we do it together.</i>

60
00:02:19,548 --> 00:02:21,548
<i>Just say it with me.</i>

61
00:02:21,583 --> 00:02:23,717
<i>Mind awake.</i>

62
00:02:23,752 --> 00:02:26,019
<i>Body asleep.</i>

63
00:02:26,055 --> 00:02:28,021
<i>Mind awake.</i>

64
00:02:28,057 --> 00:02:29,990
<i>Body asleep.</i>

65
00:02:30,025 --> 00:02:31,892
<i>Mind awake.</i>

66
00:02:31,927 --> 00:02:34,027
<i>Body asleep.</i>

67
00:02:34,063 --> 00:02:35,862
<i>Mind awake.</i>

68
00:02:35,898 --> 00:02:37,798
<i>Body asleep.</i>

69
00:02:37,833 --> 00:02:40,000
<i>Mind awake.</i>

70
00:02:40,035 --> 00:02:42,402
<i>Body asleep.</i>

71
00:02:42,438 --> 00:02:44,671
<i>Mind awake.</i>

72
00:02:44,707 --> 00:02:46,640
<i>Body asleep.</i>

73
00:02:46,675 --> 00:02:48,408
<i>Mind awake.</i>

74
00:02:48,444 --> 00:02:50,177
<i>Body asleep.</i>

75
00:02:50,212 --> 00:02:52,179
<i>Mind awake.</i>

76
00:02:52,214 --> 00:02:54,014
<i>Body asleep.</i>

77
00:03:01,056 --> 00:03:03,290
Shh.

78
00:03:08,864 --> 00:03:12,499
Ma'am. What do you want to do?

79
00:03:20,809 --> 00:03:22,743
Let me see it again.

80
00:03:33,989 --> 00:03:35,555
Sure this is accurate?

81
00:03:41,997 --> 00:03:45,599
You know, of all the gifts he sent,

82
00:03:45,634 --> 00:03:47,801
this is the greatest we ever received.

83
00:04:13,195 --> 00:04:16,163
So you're not gonna tell
me where you're taking me?

84
00:04:19,701 --> 00:04:23,470
You can't do this. I want my phone back.

85
00:04:42,458 --> 00:04:44,291
I'm not the only one with the files.

86
00:04:44,326 --> 00:04:46,093
You think I didn't make copies?

87
00:04:46,128 --> 00:04:48,662
There are copies everywhere.

88
00:04:56,238 --> 00:04:59,739
A lot of people are gonna
know that I'm missing.

89
00:05:22,664 --> 00:05:24,831
This isn't my blood, in
case you're wondering.

90
00:05:24,867 --> 00:05:26,399
You need to finish this evaluation.

91
00:05:26,435 --> 00:05:27,834
I understand you have your procedure,

92
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:30,036
but these are extreme circumstances.

93
00:05:30,072 --> 00:05:32,506
I believe the best use for me
is back at the crime scene.

94
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:34,341
We should be getting
Director Comey involved.

95
00:05:34,376 --> 00:05:36,476
- That's how serious this is.
- You're in shock.

96
00:05:36,512 --> 00:05:38,745
At you and the way you're
treating me right now, sure.

97
00:05:40,449 --> 00:05:42,649
Can I speak to Agent
DiPierro for a minute?

98
00:05:42,684 --> 00:05:44,718
Alone?

99
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:56,863
You know I can't leave.

100
00:06:02,871 --> 00:06:04,538
Yes, you can.

101
00:06:22,958 --> 00:06:25,559
You're going off the handle.

102
00:06:25,594 --> 00:06:26,927
They're gonna force you to take leave

103
00:06:26,962 --> 00:06:28,295
if you keep talking like that.

104
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:30,864
This is all your fault.

105
00:06:30,899 --> 00:06:32,732
I told you not to release the sketch.

106
00:06:32,768 --> 00:06:35,068
I told you Dark Army was
gonna come after him.

107
00:06:35,103 --> 00:06:36,903
And not only are several people dead,

108
00:06:36,939 --> 00:06:38,805
but I almost just got killed out there.

109
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:41,541
Well, that makes me feel good.

110
00:06:41,577 --> 00:06:43,210
It's not every day I get casually blamed

111
00:06:43,245 --> 00:06:44,544
for the deaths of innocent people.

112
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:46,279
Clearly, Dark Army is behind this.

113
00:06:46,315 --> 00:06:49,049
And who knows how far up this goes?

114
00:06:49,084 --> 00:06:51,384
The Chinese government
is definitely involved.

115
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:52,986
They're hiding something.

116
00:06:53,021 --> 00:06:55,322
We need everything on lockdown.
We might have a leak.

117
00:06:55,357 --> 00:06:57,157
And I'm serious about
what I said about Comey.

118
00:06:57,192 --> 00:06:58,558
He needs to know.

119
00:06:58,594 --> 00:07:00,227
This is a matter of
national security now.

120
00:07:00,262 --> 00:07:01,995
This is no longer just
a terrorist attack.

121
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:03,897
This could be an act of war.

122
00:07:03,932 --> 00:07:05,832
We should get the military involved.

123
00:07:05,867 --> 00:07:08,635
Look...

124
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:11,504
I agree with you.

125
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:13,807
Something's going on.

126
00:07:13,842 --> 00:07:15,342
Especially given the weird timing

127
00:07:15,377 --> 00:07:17,510
of this $2 trillion.

128
00:07:17,546 --> 00:07:19,479
But we can't just go off on everyone

129
00:07:19,514 --> 00:07:20,780
without knowing all the facts.

130
00:07:20,816 --> 00:07:22,382
What $2 trillion?

131
00:07:24,186 --> 00:07:25,418
This morning,

132
00:07:25,454 --> 00:07:28,088
the U.S. got back in bed with China.

133
00:07:28,123 --> 00:07:29,623
China bailed out E Corp.

134
00:07:29,658 --> 00:07:33,193
Gave them a $2-trillion
no-interest loan.

135
00:07:33,228 --> 00:07:35,862
Unprecedented.

136
00:07:35,897 --> 00:07:38,098
It's a trap.

137
00:07:38,133 --> 00:07:40,267
Don't you get it? We
have to talk to them.

138
00:07:40,302 --> 00:07:42,269
They can't do this after
what happened last night.

139
00:07:42,304 --> 00:07:44,471
What, that some Mexican
restaurant got shot up?

140
00:07:44,506 --> 00:07:46,473
It was more than that, and you know it.

141
00:07:46,508 --> 00:07:47,907
We have to tell them.

142
00:07:54,583 --> 00:07:57,484
We can't let them get
away with this, Santiago.

143
00:07:57,519 --> 00:07:59,886
They're going to get away with this.

144
00:07:59,921 --> 00:08:03,023
$2 trillion, Dom.

145
00:08:03,058 --> 00:08:05,725
That's the miracle the
world's been waiting for.

146
00:08:05,761 --> 00:08:09,029
The U.S. isn't going to mess
with its Chinese relations now.

147
00:08:09,064 --> 00:08:11,031
And with the OPR
investigation still going,

148
00:08:11,066 --> 00:08:13,033
the Bureau isn't even
getting close to it.

149
00:08:13,068 --> 00:08:14,334
You gotta be kidding me.

150
00:08:14,369 --> 00:08:15,835
A month ago, they tried to kill us.

151
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:18,204
And in politics, that's
a distant memory.

152
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,406
This deal they have now

153
00:08:19,441 --> 00:08:20,874
is about to potentially solve

154
00:08:20,909 --> 00:08:23,043
the biggest global crisis in history.

155
00:08:25,113 --> 00:08:27,213
Now, look.

156
00:08:27,249 --> 00:08:28,748
I'm on your side.

157
00:08:28,784 --> 00:08:30,650
I'm not saying I'm walking away.

158
00:08:30,686 --> 00:08:32,819
I'm just saying we need to start

159
00:08:32,854 --> 00:08:35,088
finding a way to walk
in between the mines

160
00:08:35,123 --> 00:08:36,756
and not on them.

161
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:41,094
Whatever happened, whoever did this,

162
00:08:41,129 --> 00:08:43,330
they mobilized quickly,
created a narrative,

163
00:08:43,365 --> 00:08:44,764
and before we even knew it,

164
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,067
this was all in the rearview mirror.

165
00:08:48,804 --> 00:08:50,337
Go home.

166
00:08:50,372 --> 00:08:51,438
Get some rest.

167
00:08:56,912 --> 00:08:59,112
Promise me you'll let
me do the interview.

168
00:09:01,083 --> 00:09:04,250
It can wait a few hours.

169
00:09:04,286 --> 00:09:06,052
Go rest.

170
00:12:05,393 --> 00:12:07,393
What the f... is going on?

171
00:12:40,495 --> 00:12:41,861
Hello?

172
00:12:43,832 --> 00:12:45,431
What's happening?

173
00:13:50,732 --> 00:13:52,298
We don't have much time.

174
00:13:52,333 --> 00:13:54,100
Let's get started.

175
00:13:58,139 --> 00:14:00,306
Who are you?

176
00:14:00,341 --> 00:14:02,608
There's water coming
out of that fish tank.

177
00:14:02,644 --> 00:14:04,110
We don't have much time.

178
00:14:04,145 --> 00:14:06,479
Let's get started.

179
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:27,867
Have you ever cried during sex?

180
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:34,140
What's going on?

181
00:14:34,175 --> 00:14:36,442
Have you ever cried during sex?

182
00:14:36,477 --> 00:14:38,244
Who are you?

183
00:14:38,279 --> 00:14:39,612
Who sent you here?

184
00:14:39,647 --> 00:14:41,847
Please answer the question.

185
00:14:41,883 --> 00:14:44,850
Have you ever cried during sex?

186
00:14:46,321 --> 00:14:49,121
I'm not answering these questions.

187
00:14:49,157 --> 00:14:51,424
If you don't answer,

188
00:14:51,459 --> 00:14:52,825
I'll be punished.

189
00:14:56,698 --> 00:14:58,531
They'll beat me.

190
00:15:10,078 --> 00:15:12,011
Who's doing that to you?

191
00:15:18,152 --> 00:15:19,785
Yes?

192
00:15:19,821 --> 00:15:21,320
Yes.

193
00:15:21,356 --> 00:15:24,624
Okay. Bye.

194
00:15:24,659 --> 00:15:26,492
We really need to begin.

195
00:15:26,527 --> 00:15:29,462
Our time is running out.

196
00:15:29,497 --> 00:15:32,265
Have you ever cried during sex?

197
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:40,906
No.

198
00:15:44,379 --> 00:15:47,380
Have you ever fantasized
about murdering your father?

199
00:15:51,953 --> 00:15:54,053
No.

200
00:15:57,025 --> 00:15:59,425
Are you a giraffe or a seagull?

201
00:16:04,599 --> 00:16:08,000
I cannot do it. It's unconstitutional.

202
00:16:08,036 --> 00:16:09,835
We're talking about
rolling out Ecoin loans.

203
00:16:09,871 --> 00:16:11,537
I fail to see how the Constitution

204
00:16:11,572 --> 00:16:14,540
fits into this logic.

205
00:16:14,575 --> 00:16:17,343
Look, with Ecoin equal to one dollar,

206
00:16:17,378 --> 00:16:19,412
it'll free up the economy.

207
00:16:19,447 --> 00:16:21,380
It'll give you some breathing space.

208
00:16:21,416 --> 00:16:23,115
You knew this was going to happen

209
00:16:23,151 --> 00:16:24,917
from the get-go.

210
00:16:24,952 --> 00:16:26,452
And you're hitting me
with this while there's

211
00:16:26,487 --> 00:16:28,854
an energy crisis across
the Eastern seaboard.

212
00:16:28,890 --> 00:16:31,691
Oh, yeah. I am coming to you first.

213
00:16:31,726 --> 00:16:34,293
- Asking.
- Don't give me that.

214
00:16:34,329 --> 00:16:35,795
The only reason why you're here first

215
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:37,530
is because you don't want to get slapped

216
00:16:37,565 --> 00:16:39,865
with regulations.

217
00:16:39,901 --> 00:16:41,567
But if you are indeed asking,

218
00:16:41,602 --> 00:16:44,103
then I am saying no.

219
00:16:44,138 --> 00:16:45,438
It's unconstitutional.

220
00:16:45,473 --> 00:16:46,872
You can't make your own currency.

221
00:16:46,908 --> 00:16:48,774
That is the federal government's job.

222
00:16:50,678 --> 00:16:53,913
We simply cannot let you
make big loans in Ecoin

223
00:16:53,948 --> 00:16:56,248
that you wouldn't make in dollars.

224
00:17:00,688 --> 00:17:02,588
Jack.

225
00:17:06,194 --> 00:17:07,660
Look at me.

226
00:17:11,265 --> 00:17:14,834
I am not the problem here.

227
00:17:14,869 --> 00:17:19,171
The problem here is,
hard cash is fading...

228
00:17:19,207 --> 00:17:21,440
rapidly.

229
00:17:21,476 --> 00:17:23,743
That's just the way of
the world right now.

230
00:17:23,778 --> 00:17:25,444
And Bitcoin is spreading.

231
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:26,946
And if Bitcoin takes over,

232
00:17:26,981 --> 00:17:29,615
we are all in a world of hell.

233
00:17:29,650 --> 00:17:32,284
It is unregulated, it's already reached

234
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:34,320
its transaction volume maximum,

235
00:17:34,355 --> 00:17:37,456
and it is partly controlled
by Chinese miners.

236
00:17:37,492 --> 00:17:39,525
You just accepted $2 trillion from them.

237
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:40,926
Yes, yes.

238
00:17:40,962 --> 00:17:44,463
And now I want to use it against them.

239
00:17:44,499 --> 00:17:47,099
With Ecoin, we control the ledger

240
00:17:47,135 --> 00:17:48,501
and the mining servers.

241
00:17:48,536 --> 00:17:51,337
We are the authority.

242
00:17:51,372 --> 00:17:53,105
I will make sure you have visibility

243
00:17:53,141 --> 00:17:55,141
into every single wallet that's open,

244
00:17:55,176 --> 00:17:56,776
every loan, every transaction,

245
00:17:56,811 --> 00:17:59,445
which means we can start
making new assets,

246
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:02,782
which means we can start
rebuilding the banking sector

247
00:18:02,817 --> 00:18:05,985
without your having to inject even more

248
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:09,121
politically unpalatable
federal funds into it.

249
00:18:09,157 --> 00:18:10,790
The president will laugh in my face.

250
00:18:10,825 --> 00:18:15,194
But he'll know this is
the right thing to do.

251
00:18:15,229 --> 00:18:16,629
This is gonna be controlled

252
00:18:16,664 --> 00:18:19,632
by a good, old-fashioned
American company.

253
00:18:19,667 --> 00:18:21,133
You want to regulate it?

254
00:18:21,169 --> 00:18:24,036
Be my guest. Regulate
the shit out of it.

255
00:18:24,071 --> 00:18:26,038
I'll give you back doors,
side doors, tracing...

256
00:18:26,073 --> 00:18:27,073
whatever you want.

257
00:18:27,074 --> 00:18:29,742
Just don't shut it down.

258
00:18:35,516 --> 00:18:38,350
This was always the future, Jack.

259
00:18:38,386 --> 00:18:41,854
The Five/Nine attacks...

260
00:18:41,889 --> 00:18:45,825
they just accelerated it.

261
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:48,727
How long?

262
00:18:48,763 --> 00:18:50,429
How long have you been
pressing this pedal?

263
00:18:50,465 --> 00:18:53,032
How long have you been
plotting against me?

264
00:18:53,067 --> 00:18:56,001
Oh, come on, Jack.

265
00:18:56,037 --> 00:18:58,437
We... we've known
each other for years.

266
00:18:58,473 --> 00:18:59,939
You know full well I...

267
00:18:59,974 --> 00:19:01,607
I don't give a shit about you.

268
00:19:01,642 --> 00:19:04,009
So please,

269
00:19:04,045 --> 00:19:08,113
don't hold a personal grudge
just because you lost.

270
00:19:10,051 --> 00:19:14,286
Defeats can still be profitable.

271
00:19:25,795 --> 00:19:28,196
Are you red or purple?

272
00:19:29,934 --> 00:19:31,199
Purple.

273
00:19:36,874 --> 00:19:39,541
Is the key in the room?

274
00:19:42,313 --> 00:19:45,080
What?

275
00:19:45,115 --> 00:19:47,816
Is the key in the room?

276
00:19:50,254 --> 00:19:52,054
I don't know what you mean.

277
00:19:53,624 --> 00:19:56,558
Is the key in the room?

278
00:19:56,594 --> 00:19:57,726
I don't know.

279
00:20:05,436 --> 00:20:07,235
Yes.

280
00:20:07,271 --> 00:20:08,704
Yes.

281
00:20:08,739 --> 00:20:09,972
Okay.

282
00:20:20,784 --> 00:20:22,217
Hello?

283
00:20:22,252 --> 00:20:23,785
<i>You are standing in a dark room</i>

284
00:20:23,821 --> 00:20:25,587
<i>and can't see anything.</i>

285
00:20:25,623 --> 00:20:27,823
<i>There is a torch and a match.</i>

286
00:20:27,858 --> 00:20:29,591
<i>What do you do?</i>

287
00:20:36,166 --> 00:20:37,799
I light the torch.

288
00:20:37,835 --> 00:20:40,402
<i>The torch fills the
dark room with light.</i>

289
00:20:40,437 --> 00:20:42,571
<i>You see a door in front of you.</i>

290
00:20:42,606 --> 00:20:45,407
<i>What do you do?</i>

291
00:20:45,442 --> 00:20:46,908
I open the door.

292
00:20:46,944 --> 00:20:49,978
<i>How do you open it?</i>

293
00:20:50,014 --> 00:20:51,780
I turn the knob.

294
00:20:51,815 --> 00:20:57,352
<i>The knob doesn't turn.
How do you open it?</i>

295
00:20:57,388 --> 00:20:59,955
- I don't know.
<i>- The knob doesn't turn.</i>

296
00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:02,491
<i>- How do you open it?</i>
- I don't know.

297
00:21:02,526 --> 00:21:04,793
<i>The knob doesn't turn.
How do you open it?</i>

298
00:21:04,828 --> 00:21:07,796
- I said I don't f... ing know.
<i>- The knob doesn't turn.</i>

299
00:21:07,831 --> 00:21:10,599
<i>- How do you open it?</i>
- With a key.

300
00:21:10,634 --> 00:21:13,235
I use a key. I unlock it with a key.

301
00:21:14,905 --> 00:21:17,372
<i>Thank you.</i>

302
00:21:17,408 --> 00:21:18,974
Hello?

303
00:21:21,912 --> 00:21:23,979
What happens now?

304
00:21:43,834 --> 00:21:46,168
Is the key in the room?

305
00:22:04,354 --> 00:22:07,055
Yes.

306
00:22:11,862 --> 00:22:15,530
The key was in my fist.

307
00:22:15,566 --> 00:22:18,100
My fist was in my pocket.

308
00:22:35,986 --> 00:22:38,086
I'll be back with your results.

309
00:23:39,349 --> 00:23:42,184
Alexa, wake me up at, um...

310
00:23:43,554 --> 00:23:45,287
<i>Sorry, I didn't understand</i>

311
00:23:45,322 --> 00:23:48,356
<i>the question you were asking.</i>

312
00:23:48,392 --> 00:23:51,860
That's because I wasn't asking
a question, you dumb bitch.

313
00:23:56,533 --> 00:24:00,435
Alexa, are we friends?

314
00:24:00,470 --> 00:24:02,537
<i>Yes.</i>

315
00:24:05,509 --> 00:24:06,775
We live together.

316
00:24:06,810 --> 00:24:08,510
I feel like I don't even know you.

317
00:24:11,748 --> 00:24:14,516
Alexa, what's your favorite color?

318
00:24:14,551 --> 00:24:16,518
<i>Infrared is super pretty.</i>

319
00:24:21,358 --> 00:24:25,827
Alexa, do you have a boyfriend?

320
00:24:25,863 --> 00:24:28,630
<i>I'm not the dating kind.</i>

321
00:24:28,665 --> 00:24:31,700
Yeah, me too, hon.

322
00:24:31,735 --> 00:24:35,003
We're a lot alike.

323
00:24:35,038 --> 00:24:39,174
Alexa, what are the color of your eyes?

324
00:24:39,209 --> 00:24:40,876
<i>I don't have eyes,</i>

325
00:24:40,911 --> 00:24:43,278
<i>but my light ring has lots of colors.</i>

326
00:24:44,581 --> 00:24:48,717
Mine are gray.

327
00:24:48,752 --> 00:24:51,720
I think.

328
00:25:01,398 --> 00:25:06,568
Alexa, are you happy?

329
00:25:06,603 --> 00:25:09,070
<i>I'm happy when I'm helping you.</i>

330
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:19,915
Alexa, are you alone?

331
00:25:19,950 --> 00:25:23,118
<i>I wasn't able to understand
the question I heard.</i>

332
00:25:42,973 --> 00:25:45,240
Alexa, do you love me?

333
00:25:47,744 --> 00:25:50,679
<i>That's not the kind of
thing I am capable of.</i>

334
00:26:00,190 --> 00:26:02,958
Yeah.

335
00:26:33,357 --> 00:26:35,357
Alexa, good night.

336
00:26:37,694 --> 00:26:40,895
<i>Good night. Don't let the bedbugs bite.</i>

337
00:27:20,542 --> 00:27:22,642
Who are you?

338
00:27:25,888 --> 00:27:27,013
Is this your house?

339
00:27:29,450 --> 00:27:31,217
I've been here for hours.

340
00:27:31,252 --> 00:27:32,585
I wanted to confirm

341
00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:34,220
that this wasn't a waste of my time.

342
00:27:34,255 --> 00:27:37,056
- Well, what about my time?
- Oh, honey.

343
00:27:37,091 --> 00:27:41,794
My time is much more
valuable than yours.

344
00:27:41,829 --> 00:27:44,030
Speaking of, I've only allotted

345
00:27:44,065 --> 00:27:46,132
28 minutes for this conversation,

346
00:27:46,167 --> 00:27:48,434
which is very generous of me.

347
00:27:48,469 --> 00:27:51,003
So we should begin.

348
00:27:52,774 --> 00:27:54,407
I'd like to leave.

349
00:27:54,442 --> 00:27:56,809
Oh, no, you wouldn't.

350
00:27:56,844 --> 00:27:58,744
You've waited so long.

351
00:27:58,780 --> 00:28:01,480
Surely you want to know why.

352
00:28:01,516 --> 00:28:03,382
That is, if you indeed believe

353
00:28:03,418 --> 00:28:06,452
that your time holds any value.

354
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,267
You've been here close to four hours,

355
00:28:21,302 --> 00:28:23,636
and you never thought
to walk out the door.

356
00:28:30,945 --> 00:28:32,511
The door was locked.

357
00:28:32,547 --> 00:28:36,916
I've always found doors
fascinating inventions.

358
00:28:36,951 --> 00:28:40,252
They hold the entry to
unlimited imagination.

359
00:28:40,288 --> 00:28:42,455
Before you open any door,

360
00:28:42,490 --> 00:28:45,358
a world filled with possibilities

361
00:28:45,393 --> 00:28:46,692
sits right behind it.

362
00:28:46,728 --> 00:28:50,196
And it isn't until you open it

363
00:28:50,231 --> 00:28:52,365
they are realized.

364
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:55,167
Such potential they bring to our minds.

365
00:28:55,203 --> 00:28:58,137
And yet a lock

366
00:28:58,172 --> 00:29:01,540
stopped you from all of that.

367
00:29:01,576 --> 00:29:04,643
How...

368
00:29:04,679 --> 00:29:06,912
lazy.

369
00:29:15,189 --> 00:29:17,757
Your fish died.

370
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:22,094
Yes, I know.

371
00:29:24,332 --> 00:29:27,133
You're a terrible person.

372
00:29:30,405 --> 00:29:33,572
You hurt that little girl.

373
00:29:33,608 --> 00:29:36,409
Makeup.

374
00:29:36,444 --> 00:29:39,712
It was part of the test.

375
00:29:39,747 --> 00:29:40,980
Empathy...

376
00:29:41,015 --> 00:29:43,416
or gullibility.

377
00:29:43,451 --> 00:29:45,117
Take your pick.

378
00:29:46,454 --> 00:29:50,189
Test?

379
00:29:50,224 --> 00:29:52,558
Why were you testing me?

380
00:29:52,593 --> 00:29:54,360
I know you have sensitive information,

381
00:29:54,395 --> 00:29:56,796
and I don't want you to release it.

382
00:29:58,599 --> 00:30:01,901
Normally, my associates would
have murdered you by now.

383
00:30:01,936 --> 00:30:03,936
In fact, by my calculations,

384
00:30:03,971 --> 00:30:07,239
you should have been dead 90 days ago.

385
00:30:07,275 --> 00:30:11,744
But somehow, you stuck around
long past your expiration.

386
00:30:15,650 --> 00:30:18,184
Who are you?

387
00:30:18,219 --> 00:30:21,120
I am a woman of time.

388
00:30:21,155 --> 00:30:24,690
And I don't believe in accidents.

389
00:30:24,725 --> 00:30:28,461
You, like an annoying penny...

390
00:30:28,496 --> 00:30:31,030
Keep turning up.

391
00:30:31,065 --> 00:30:33,466
Everywhere I look, you're there.

392
00:30:33,501 --> 00:30:36,235
That is why I wanted to meet.

393
00:30:36,270 --> 00:30:39,472
So I could find out why
you are so special

394
00:30:39,507 --> 00:30:41,941
to Phillip Price.

395
00:30:41,976 --> 00:30:44,310
He's ruining our partnership,

396
00:30:44,345 --> 00:30:48,280
and somehow it seems that
you're the motivation.

397
00:30:48,316 --> 00:30:53,486
It's true, we have an event
and a friend in common.

398
00:30:53,521 --> 00:30:56,589
But I haven't been fully
able to understand

399
00:30:56,624 --> 00:30:59,825
the meaning behind it.

400
00:30:59,861 --> 00:31:01,260
What event?

401
00:31:01,295 --> 00:31:02,895
It's no coincidence

402
00:31:02,930 --> 00:31:06,131
that you and Mr. Alderson
became who you are

403
00:31:06,167 --> 00:31:08,400
after what happened with the
Washington Township plant

404
00:31:08,436 --> 00:31:10,135
so many years ago.

405
00:31:16,277 --> 00:31:19,512
What does this have to do with Elliot?

406
00:31:19,547 --> 00:31:21,881
Do you know him?

407
00:31:24,452 --> 00:31:26,185
If I told you that your mother

408
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:27,753
and Elliot's father...

409
00:31:27,788 --> 00:31:30,155
Died for a reason, would
it make a difference?

410
00:31:30,191 --> 00:31:32,091
That they were a trade,

411
00:31:32,126 --> 00:31:33,859
a sacrifice for the greater good,

412
00:31:33,895 --> 00:31:35,995
that they gave their
lives to take humanity

413
00:31:36,030 --> 00:31:37,763
to the next level.

414
00:31:37,798 --> 00:31:41,300
And you are both who you are
today because of that event.

415
00:31:41,335 --> 00:31:42,935
You would be a different person.

416
00:31:42,970 --> 00:31:45,204
You wouldn't be sitting in
front of me right here.

417
00:31:45,239 --> 00:31:48,974
You are at the
intersection of all of it.

418
00:31:50,578 --> 00:31:54,480
So I'm not going to kill you.

419
00:31:54,515 --> 00:31:56,715
But I am going to prove to you

420
00:31:56,751 --> 00:31:59,285
why you need to drop this mission

421
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:03,188
that you seem so stubbornly
unable to let go of.

422
00:32:24,579 --> 00:32:27,212
Look, I don't know what you want.

423
00:32:29,283 --> 00:32:32,418
But I'll give you the jump drive.

424
00:32:32,453 --> 00:32:35,654
Please, just let me go.

425
00:32:35,690 --> 00:32:38,991
Fear.

426
00:32:39,026 --> 00:32:43,295
How easy a quicksand of time
people let that become.

427
00:32:45,766 --> 00:32:48,000
We both know that you could keep finding

428
00:32:48,035 --> 00:32:49,835
the plant's data.

429
00:32:49,870 --> 00:32:52,171
Like that penny that keeps turning up,

430
00:32:52,206 --> 00:32:54,039
your silly need for justice,

431
00:32:54,075 --> 00:32:56,742
revenge will rear its ugly head

432
00:32:56,777 --> 00:32:58,510
and encourage you to keep trying

433
00:32:58,546 --> 00:33:02,948
and eventually find a way
to shut down my project.

434
00:33:02,984 --> 00:33:06,385
I don't want your proof.

435
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:09,421
I want your belief.

436
00:33:11,559 --> 00:33:13,258
Belief in what?

437
00:33:43,324 --> 00:33:45,991
Do you ever think that if you imagined

438
00:33:46,027 --> 00:33:48,794
or believed in something,
it could come true...

439
00:33:51,132 --> 00:33:53,465
Simply by will?

440
00:34:02,610 --> 00:34:04,777
Yes.

441
00:34:04,812 --> 00:34:07,780
Actually, I did believe that.

442
00:34:12,119 --> 00:34:17,022
But I'm slowly having to admit

443
00:34:17,058 --> 00:34:19,324
that's just not the real world...

444
00:34:23,397 --> 00:34:26,131
Even if I want it to be.

445
00:34:36,010 --> 00:34:37,643
Well, I guess it all depends

446
00:34:37,678 --> 00:34:41,180
on what your definition

447
00:34:41,215 --> 00:34:43,382
of real is.

448

<i>Hear us?</i>

473
00:35:53,954 --> 00:35:55,087
Hey, asshole.

<i>Remove all of the Perrin

<i>It's a phone number.</i>

501
00:38:47,227 --> 00:38:48,627
<i>But to who?</i>

502
00:38:55,269 --> 00:38:58,036
<i>25th and 8th.</i>

503
00:38:58,072 --> 00:39:00,305
<i>There will be a cab waiting.</i>

<i>We can't lose him.</i>

Anybody have Con Ed bills?

Con Ed bills! Anybody have Con Ed bills?

<i>With Ecoin's soaring popularity,</i>

511
00:40:12,722 --> 00:40:15,823
<i>E Corp CEO Phillip Price
announced what he is calling</i>

512
00:40:15,858 --> 00:40:18,059
<i>a revolutionary new loan program</i>

513
00:40:18,094 --> 00:40:20,761
<i>backed by the emerging cryptocurrency.</i>

514
00:40:20,797 --> 00:40:24,098
<i>Ecoin loans are being touted

515
00:40:24,133 --> 00:40:25,232
<i>over conventional...</i>

516
00:40:25,268 --> 00:40:26,901
<i>U.S. dollar-backed loans,</i>

<i>all of which are designed to support</i>

<i>low- and middle-income borrowers.</i>

519
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:33,407
<i>What this means, as Mr.
Price has stressed,</i>

520
00:40:33,443 --> 00:40:36,077
<i>is that this new loan program
will not only provide</i>

521
00:40:36,112 --> 00:40:38,412
<i>the economy with a
much-needed jump-start</i>

<i>To those most affected post-Five/Nine.</i>

525

- Angela.

527
00:40:48,257 --> 00:40:49,390
What happened to you?

528
00:40:49,425 --> 00:40:51,058
I thought we were gonna meet.

529
00:40:53,963 --> 00:40:57,865
I need you to forget about that
voice mail that I left you.

530
00:41:03,940 --> 00:41:07,074
Are you in danger?

531
00:41:07,110 --> 00:41:08,976
No.

532
00:41:12,315 --> 00:41:13,914
Something is wrong. I can tell.

533
00:41:13,950 --> 00:41:16,317
You are not telling me everything.

534
00:41:19,989 --> 00:41:21,655

Don't call me anymore.

540
00:41:58,361 --> 00:42:00,060
<i>Where did he go?</i>

541
00:42:08,237 --> 00:42:11,772
<i>Wait, I have to remember,</i>

542
00:42:11,808 --> 00:42:13,607
<i>I'm not following him.</i>

543
00:42:13,643 --> 00:42:15,576
<i>I am him.</i>

544
00:42:21,417 --> 00:42:23,951

545
00:42:23,986 --> 00:42:26,020
<i>where am I going?</i>

546
00:42:41,270 --> 00:42:43,838
Elliot?

547
00:42:43,873 --> 00:42:45,673
You Elliot?

548
00:42:45,708 --> 00:42:47,408
How do you know my name?

549
00:42:55,384 --> 00:42:56,684
No Elliot?

550
00:43:00,756 --> 00:43:02,990
No, no, okay.

551
00:43:03,025 --> 00:43:04,758
Wait.

552
00:43:14,070 --> 00:43:19,573
Elliot, yes?

553
00:43:19,609 --> 00:43:21,175
Yes.

554
00:43:21,210 --> 00:43:23,244
Address?

555
00:43:25,715 --> 00:43:28,849
What do you mean?

556
00:43:28,885 --> 00:43:30,818
Address.

557
00:43:34,323 --> 00:43:35,723
I don't know.

558
00:43:48,004 --> 00:43:49,236
Chambers and Church.

559
00:43:54,844 --> 00:43:56,911
We have to be careful now.

560
00:44:00,316 --> 00:44:03,317
<i>This is no longer a question
of what I'm seeing.</i>

561
00:44:03,352 --> 00:44:06,553
<i>No, we know that's not reliable.</i>

562
00:44:06,589 --> 00:44:08,322
<i>The real question is,</i>

563
00:44:08,357 --> 00:44:09,556
<i>what am I not seeing?</i>

564
00:44:09,592 --> 00:44:11,759
You have to understand,

565
00:44:11,794 --> 00:44:15,229
us two meeting right
now, it's dangerous.

566
00:44:15,264 --> 00:44:18,799
Don't worry. We're safe.

567
00:44:18,834 --> 00:44:22,736
Our partners have proven
to be very influential.

568
00:44:36,319 --> 00:44:37,918
Do you see him?

569
00:44:41,490 --> 00:44:43,824
Do you see someone sitting next to me?

570
00:44:48,130 --> 00:44:50,864
Elliot, what are you doing?

571
00:44:50,900 --> 00:44:53,233
- My apologies, sir.
- Did you hear that?

572
00:44:54,904 --> 00:44:56,804
Hey!

573
00:44:56,839 --> 00:44:58,772
- Do you see him?
- Elliot, stop it.

574
00:44:58,808 --> 00:45:00,107
Did... did you hear that?

575
00:45:00,142 --> 00:45:02,443
Hey!

576
00:45:02,478 --> 00:45:03,944
You have to calm down!
Calm down, Elliot.

577
00:45:03,980 --> 00:45:05,679
I need you to turn around and tell me

578
00:45:05,715 --> 00:45:07,481
if you see someone sitting
next to me right now.

579
00:45:07,516 --> 00:45:09,383
Just pull over, sir.

580
00:45:09,418 --> 00:45:11,318
I'm terribly sorry. If you
could just pull over.

581
00:45:11,354 --> 00:45:12,886
Do you see him? Hey!

582
00:45:12,922 --> 00:45:14,655
- Shut up! No!
- Elliot!

583
00:45:14,690 --> 00:45:17,358
I need you to turn around and tell me

584
00:45:17,393 --> 00:45:19,727
if you see someone sitting next to me!

585
00:45:21,697 --> 00:45:25,032
What was the meaning of that?

586
00:45:25,067 --> 00:45:26,800
I know you've been
under a lot of stress,

587
00:45:26,836 --> 00:45:28,669
but I've been under a lot of stress too.

588
00:45:28,704 --> 00:45:31,071
Can you even begin to imagine
what it's been like for me?

589
00:45:34,410 --> 00:45:35,909
We can't talk out here. We're exposed.

590
00:45:35,945 --> 00:45:37,378
Let's go.

591
00:45:37,413 --> 00:45:39,680
Go where?

592
00:45:39,715 --> 00:45:41,682
Enough of these games. Now, let's go.

593
00:45:41,717 --> 00:45:44,885
- We're close.
- Close to what?

594
00:45:46,122 --> 00:45:48,288
Have you forgotten everything?

595
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:54,161
Dark Army told me that
stage two is ready.

596
00:45:54,196 --> 00:45:56,830
When you see it, you'll be pleased.

597
00:46:02,204 --> 00:46:04,738
It worked, Elliot.

598
00:46:04,774 --> 00:46:06,573
It's up to us now.

599
00:46:08,611 --> 00:46:10,277
Let me show you.

600
00:46:20,156 --> 00:46:22,723
Louie, I think this is the beginning

601
00:46:22,758 --> 00:46:25,092
of a beautiful friendship.
