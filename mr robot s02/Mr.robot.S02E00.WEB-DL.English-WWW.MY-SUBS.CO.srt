00:00:11,593 --> 00:00:13,263
My fellow Americans,

2
00:00:13,296 --> 00:00:15,599
no hacker should be able to
shut down our networks...

3
00:00:15,633 --> 00:00:16,769
<i>A massive attack.</i>

4
00:00:16,802 --> 00:00:18,538
<i>Data is inaccessible.</i>

5
00:00:18,572 --> 00:00:21,311
Or invade the privacy
of American families.

6
00:00:21,345 --> 00:00:23,448
You're being watched and recorded.

7
00:00:23,482 --> 00:00:24,685
I urge this Congress

8
00:00:24,717 --> 00:00:28,491
to protect our children's information.

9
00:00:28,525 --> 00:00:30,061
<i>Dear brothers and sisters,</i>

10
00:00:30,094 --> 00:00:32,732
now is the time to open your eyes.

11
00:00:32,765 --> 00:00:36,372
<i>I started intercepting all
the traffic on your network.</i>

12
00:00:36,406 --> 00:00:38,043
<i>That's when I noticed something strange.</i>

13
00:00:38,076 --> 00:00:39,878
That's when I decided to hack you.

14
00:00:41,449 --> 00:00:43,920
<i>We are fsociety!</i>

15
00:00:43,952 --> 00:00:46,490
<i>We are finally free!</i>

16
00:00:46,524 --> 00:00:48,394
<i>We are on the verge</i>

17
00:00:48,427 --> 00:00:51,433
of taking down this virtual reality.

18
00:00:51,467 --> 00:00:54,472
Exciting time in the world
right now, exciting time.

19
00:00:56,208 --> 00:00:59,714
<i>So this is what a revolution looks like.</i>

20
00:00:59,748 --> 00:01:01,785
Why did you do it?

21
00:01:01,819 --> 00:01:04,658
I wanted to save the world.

22
00:01:04,691 --> 00:01:07,196
<i>"Mr. Robot,"
USA's Golden Globe</i>

23
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:09,601
<i>and Peabody award-winning original drama</i>

24

<i>has engaged audiences
like no other show.</i>

26
00:01:15,345 --> 00:01:17,950
"Mr. Robot" won two Golden Globes,

27
00:01:17,983 --> 00:01:19,552
three Critics' Choice Awards,

28
00:01:19,584 --> 00:01:22,357
<i>but what really says something
about "Mr. Robot" is</i>

29
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:25,562
fans found this show even
before the critics showed up,

30
00:01:25,596 --> 00:01:26,932
even before the awards showed up.

31
00:01:26,965 --> 00:01:28,534
<i>Its realistic portrayal</i>

32
00:01:28,569 --> 00:01:30,939
<i>of a world where
information is vulnerable,</i>

33
00:01:30,973 --> 00:01:34,747
<i>everyone is being watched, and
anyone can be compromised</i>

34
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:38,052
<i>has fueled its rise as
a cultural phenomenon.</i>

35
00:01:38,086 --> 00:01:39,188
"Mr. Robot" comes at a time

36
00:01:39,221 --> 00:01:41,324
where you can't turn on the television

37
00:01:41,358 --> 00:01:42,896
or read a newspaper without hearing

38
00:01:42,929 --> 00:01:45,333
about some massive corporate
or government hack.

39
00:01:45,366 --> 00:01:46,802
<i>But how much of the world</i>

40
00:01:46,834 --> 00:01:49,473
<i>portrayed by "Mr. Robot" is possible?</i>

41
00:01:49,507 --> 00:01:51,110
<i>A lot more than you might think.</i>

42
00:01:51,143 --> 00:01:53,514
<i>Over the next hour, we'll examine</i>

43
00:01:53,548 --> 00:01:57,522
<i>what's truly at risk in our
technology-obsessed world.</i>

44
00:01:57,554 --> 00:02:00,026
The only completely secure computer

45
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:02,598
is a computer that no one can use.

46
00:02:02,631 --> 00:02:04,834
<i>We'll talk
to the creator and cast</i>

47
00:02:04,868 --> 00:02:06,705
<i>as well as pop culture experts</i>

48
00:02:06,738 --> 00:02:10,177
<i>about why "Mr. Robot" has
resonated so powerfully.</i>

49
00:02:10,212 --> 00:02:12,983
Something incredibly prophetic
happened on the show,

50
00:02:13,017 --> 00:02:16,356
almost, you know, weeks away
from it happening in real life.

51
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:18,795
<i>And through
unprecedented access</i>

52
00:02:18,827 --> 00:02:21,632
<i>to cybersecurity experts
and real-life hackers,</i>

53
00:02:21,666 --> 00:02:25,940
<i>we'll reveal how "Mr. Robot" is
mirroring real-world scenarios</i>

54
00:02:25,974 --> 00:02:27,444
<i>if not outright predicting them.</i>

55
00:02:27,477 --> 00:02:29,949
You look at the hacks that
played out in season one...

56
00:02:29,981 --> 00:02:31,951
gaining access to Steel Mountain,

57
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:33,153
<i>bumping next to someone</i>

58
00:02:33,188 --> 00:02:35,927
<i>to steal and clone
their proximity badge,</i>

59
00:02:35,959 --> 00:02:37,262
<i>getting a backdoor in a phone...</i>

60
00:02:37,296 --> 00:02:40,368
all of those are hacks that
we read about in the news

61
00:02:40,402 --> 00:02:41,637
every week now.

62
00:02:41,671 --> 00:02:43,474
<i>Plus, we'll also discuss</i>

63
00:02:43,506 --> 00:02:45,042
<i>what's in store for season two.</i>

64
00:02:45,076 --> 00:02:48,348
The second season... it's very
different from season one.

65
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:55,629
<i>This is "Mr. Robot dec0d3d."</i>

66

And the Golden Globe goes to...

67
00:02:59,969 --> 00:03:01,873
"Mr. Robot." Yep.

68
00:03:01,908 --> 00:03:03,878
<i>"Mr. Robot"
is the brainchild</i>

69
00:03:03,911 --> 00:03:05,447
<i>of creator Sam Esmail.</i>

70
00:03:05,481 --> 00:03:07,952
"Mr. Robot" is about this
sort of modern society

71
00:03:07,985 --> 00:03:10,055
and the way we're so
dependent on technology

72
00:03:10,089 --> 00:03:11,458
<i>just to even socialize,</i>

73
00:03:11,492 --> 00:03:14,331
so it's really about this
guy who cannot connect,

74
00:03:14,363 --> 00:03:16,968
and the only way he does
so is by hacking people.

75

<i>"Mr. Robot" tells
the story of Elliot Alderson.</i>

76

<i>By night, he's a socially withdrawn</i>

77

78

<i>to expose the misdeeds of others.</i>

79

Wait, hold on. I'll give you the money.

80

81

How much do you want? I'll pay you.

82
00:03:32,664 --> 00:03:35,570
That's the part you were
wrong about, Rohit.

83
00:03:35,602 --> 00:03:37,605
I don't give a shit about money.

<i>By day, he's

88
00:03:48,626 --> 00:03:53,235
What if you could take
down one conglomerate,

89
00:03:53,268 --> 00:03:56,574
a conglomerate so deeply entrenched

90

in the world's economy
that "too big to fail"

91

Getting in Elliot's head,

103

<i>has struck a chord with viewers.</i>

124
00:05:26,975 --> 00:05:28,477
The world of hacking really

125
00:05:28,511 --> 00:05:31,884
is sort of an obscure world
to the general population,

126
00:05:31,917 --> 00:05:34,723
so the fact that we broke
out in any way like that

127
00:05:34,756 --> 00:05:36,458
is incredibly shocking.

133
00:05:46,143 --> 00:05:48,648
I think "Mr. Robot"
made such an impression

137
00:05:53,958 --> 00:05:56,329

I think "Mr. Robot"
really taps into that.

142
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:09,254
This is very much a show

149
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:25,149
a lot of people practically
just shrug, like,

150
00:06:25,182 --> 00:06:26,651
"Yeah, yeah, probably...

00:06:42,614 --> 00:06:44,651
<i>Then I witnessed the first
of many infidelities</i>

159
00:06:44,686 --> 00:06:46,489
<i>with Stella B.</i>

160
00:06:46,521 --> 00:06:48,458
Everything about us is all digital.

161
00:06:48,492 --> 00:06:50,061
It's all in a cloud.

162
00:06:50,095 --> 00:06:52,332
<i>Now you can go get somebody's
social security, fingerprints,</i>

163
00:06:52,365 --> 00:06:53,701
<i>images, everything.</i>

164
00:06:53,735 --> 00:06:56,004
<i>You can literally take
over their entire life.</i>

165
00:06:56,038 --> 00:06:57,708
That's frightening.

166
00:06:57,742 --> 00:06:59,512
<i>It's not like they're talking about it</i>

167
00:06:59,545 --> 00:07:00,646
<i>in science-fiction terms.</i>

168
00:07:00,681 --> 00:07:02,084
What they're tackling is something

169
00:07:02,117 --> 00:07:04,021
that's actually currently,
right now happening.

170
00:07:05,958 --> 00:07:08,864
<i>Coming up on "Mr.
Robot dec0d3d,"</i>

171
00:07:08,896 --> 00:07:11,667
<i>we'll take a deeper look at the
rise of hacking culture...</i>

172
00:07:11,701 --> 00:07:13,004
<i>There's always been a little bit</i>

173
00:07:13,037 --> 00:07:15,374
of wish fulfillment to hacker stories

174
00:07:15,408 --> 00:07:18,814
in that they are the sort
of modern superheroes.

175
00:07:18,848 --> 00:07:20,751
<i>And learn
how a Hollywood movie</i>

176
00:07:20,785 --> 00:07:23,624
<i>alerted a president to the
dangers of cybersecurity.</i>

177
00:07:26,129 --> 00:07:28,032
<i>Plus, we'll also discuss</i>

178
00:07:28,064 --> 00:07:30,035
<i>what's in store for season two.</i>

179
00:07:30,069 --> 00:07:34,177
But first, a word from
our corporate overlords!

180
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:39,803
Come on, kid. We got
big things in store.

181
00:07:39,836 --> 00:07:41,139
Big things.

182
00:07:41,173 --> 00:07:43,242
<i>"Mr. Robot's"
authentic portrayal</i>

183
00:07:43,276 --> 00:07:45,247
<i>of computer hacking has alerted us</i>

184
00:07:45,279 --> 00:07:47,717
<i>to the real-world dangers we all face.</i>

185
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:51,892
<i>Now we'll find out just
how much we're at risk.</i>

186
00:07:51,925 --> 00:07:55,533
<i>This is "Mr. Robot dec0d3d."</i>

187
00:07:57,704 --> 00:08:02,579
How about Global Thermonuclear War?

188
00:08:03,815 --> 00:08:06,252
<i>In 1983,
the movie "WarGames"</i>

189
00:08:06,286 --> 00:08:08,857
<i>forever changed the way
we would look at hacking.</i>

190
00:08:08,889 --> 00:08:11,961
Ronald Reagan was apparently
shown the movie "WarGames,"

191
00:08:11,995 --> 00:08:15,536
and he commissioned, you
know, a study as to:

192
00:08:15,569 --> 00:08:17,238
Is this actually possible?

193
00:08:17,271 --> 00:08:19,009
And everybody was
expecting the answer was,

194
00:08:19,043 --> 00:08:22,281
"No, you can't start, you know,
a global thermonuclear war

195
00:08:22,315 --> 00:08:24,820
"just by dialing up, you know,
a computer accidentally

196
00:08:24,853 --> 00:08:26,156
and getting it to talk to you."

197
00:08:26,189 --> 00:08:29,495
And unfortunately, the
answer came back going,

198
00:08:29,528 --> 00:08:32,500
"Well, um, this is a little
more possible than we thought."

199
00:08:32,534 --> 00:08:34,104
<i>"WarGames" also spawned</i>

200
00:08:34,137 --> 00:08:36,440
<i>a whole new generation of hackers.</i>

201
00:08:36,474 --> 00:08:38,444
I mean, I remember being a kid
and watching Matthew Broderick

202
00:08:38,478 --> 00:08:39,981
do all that and going,
"That's really cool.

203
00:08:40,015 --> 00:08:41,150
That's really awesome," you know?

204
00:08:41,184 --> 00:08:43,353
And, by the way, he saved the world.

205
00:08:43,387 --> 00:08:47,728
It's the first time that you
saw Hollywood trying to depict

206
00:08:47,762 --> 00:08:49,031
what people could do with computers

207
00:08:49,064 --> 00:08:51,168
that went beyond just playing
games and sending emails

208
00:08:51,201 --> 00:08:55,142
and got me even more excited in
computers and computer hacking.

209
00:08:55,176 --> 00:08:57,815
<i>What is hacking? Who hacks?</i>

210
00:08:57,848 --> 00:08:59,818
<i>How and why is it executed?</i>

211
00:08:59,852 --> 00:09:03,158
<i>To get the answers, we went
to world-renowned specialists</i>

212
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:04,859
<i>in the field of cybersecurity</i>

213
00:09:04,893 --> 00:09:07,431
<i>and to the foremost
experts on the subject,</i>

214
00:09:07,464 --> 00:09:08,566
<i>the hackers themselves.</i>

215
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,969
Everybody has a different answer

216
00:09:10,002 --> 00:09:13,242
on what a hacker is or what
is a hack, but for me,

217
00:09:13,276 --> 00:09:15,714
it comes down to making
technology do stuff

218
00:09:15,747 --> 00:09:17,483
it was never meant to do.

219
00:09:17,517 --> 00:09:19,922
<i>The show "Mr. Robot"
I'm particular fond of</i>

220
00:09:19,955 --> 00:09:21,959
because they point out how, oftentimes,

221
00:09:21,992 --> 00:09:24,497
it's very simplistic,
the hacking mechanism.

222
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:26,098
<i>Sometimes it's having physical access,</i>

223
00:09:26,132 --> 00:09:28,204
<i>so you can swap a SIM out in a phone.</i>

224
00:09:28,238 --> 00:09:30,007
<i>Other times, it's social engineering.</i>

225
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:33,814
It's not that they cracked
some code or some encryption.

226
00:09:33,847 --> 00:09:35,116
It's that they sent an email,

227
00:09:35,148 --> 00:09:37,219
<i>and they misrepresented
who they were, they...</i>

228
00:09:37,253 --> 00:09:39,022
<i>and got you to click on an attachment</i>

229
00:09:39,056 --> 00:09:40,693
<i>and run the code for them</i>

230
00:09:40,727 --> 00:09:42,129
or that they called up on the phone

231
00:09:42,161 --> 00:09:44,333
and pretended that they were,
you know, a technical person

232
00:09:44,367 --> 00:09:45,870
<i>to get you to give information.</i>

233
00:09:45,903 --> 00:09:47,239
<i>Hello?</i>

234
00:09:47,272 --> 00:09:50,979
Hi, this is Sam from Bank of
E security fraud department.

235
00:09:51,012 --> 00:09:52,648
Unfortunately, I have to inform you

236
00:09:52,681 --> 00:09:54,517
that your account's been compromised.

237
00:09:54,551 --> 00:09:56,889
<i>What? What happened?</i>

238
00:09:56,924 --> 00:09:59,026
First, before I can
answer any questions,

239
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:00,530
I need to verify some information.

240
00:10:00,563 --> 00:10:03,068
Are you still at 306 Hawthorne Avenue?

241
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:05,037
Yes, apartment 2C.

242
00:10:05,071 --> 00:10:07,408
Great, and your security question,

243
00:10:07,443 --> 00:10:08,779
favorite baseball team.

244
00:10:08,811 --> 00:10:10,681
<i>Um, Yankees.</i>

245
00:10:10,715 --> 00:10:12,585
<i>I don't remember this being
a security question.</i>

246
00:10:12,618 --> 00:10:14,254
And lastly, your pet's name.

247
00:10:14,289 --> 00:10:16,928
<i>Um, Flipper. Uh, who am I speaking to?</i>

248
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:19,932
<i>Can I get your name and numb...</i>

249
00:10:19,965 --> 00:10:22,302
<i>With those details plus a
dictionary brute-force attack,</i>

250
00:10:22,337 --> 00:10:24,173
<i>it'll take my program maybe two minutes</i>

251
00:10:24,207 --> 00:10:25,443
<i>to crack his password.</i>

252
00:10:25,475 --> 00:10:26,711
<i>The last five, ten years,</i>

253
00:10:26,744 --> 00:10:29,316
<i>hacking has become like a new superpower</i>

254
00:10:29,349 --> 00:10:30,651
that hasn't been invented,

255
00:10:30,685 --> 00:10:33,925
and because of everyone's
reliance on technology

256
00:10:33,958 --> 00:10:35,828
and all your personal
information being online,

257
00:10:35,862 --> 00:10:38,334
<i>this power just sort of came about.</i>

258
00:10:38,367 --> 00:10:39,669
<i>Hacking her was simple.</i>

259
00:10:39,701 --> 00:10:41,805
<i>Her password: Dylan 2791.</i>

260
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:43,175
<i>Favorite artist</i>

261
00:10:43,209 --> 00:10:45,847
<i>and the year in which she
was born, backwards.</i>

262
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:49,620
<i>People are horrible at being
sources of randomness,</i>

263
00:10:49,653 --> 00:10:51,223
so, you know, somebody might think,

264
00:10:51,257 --> 00:10:53,194
"Oh, I used my dog's
name, my baby's name,

265
00:10:53,228 --> 00:10:55,430
and the birth... and the birth date."

266
00:10:55,464 --> 00:10:56,632
That's a horrible password.

267
00:10:56,666 --> 00:10:58,670
It might seem complicated to you,

268
00:10:58,704 --> 00:11:00,574
but we know how you think
because you're a human,

269
00:11:00,608 --> 00:11:01,843
and humans are predictable.

270
00:11:01,877 --> 00:11:03,213
<i>This doesn't make sense.</i>

271
00:11:03,246 --> 00:11:04,682
<i>Did he know I was gonna hack him?</i>

272
00:11:04,714 --> 00:11:07,051
<i>Did he let me?</i>

273
00:11:07,085 --> 00:11:10,157
<i>I'm gonna need to wipe everything.</i>

274
00:11:10,191 --> 00:11:13,363
"Hackers," you know, it
used to be a nasty word.

275
00:11:13,397 --> 00:11:15,567
It was, like, synonymous
with "criminal,"

276
00:11:15,602 --> 00:11:17,973
but now they're part of the system.

277
00:11:18,007 --> 00:11:21,346
<i>But not all hackers
are cut from the same cloth.</i>

278
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:24,052
So a white hat hacker is one

279
00:11:24,084 --> 00:11:28,025
who would be hired by a corporation

280
00:11:28,058 --> 00:11:29,361
<i>to hack their systems</i>

281
00:11:29,393 --> 00:11:32,231
for the sole purpose
of finding the flaws,

282
00:11:32,266 --> 00:11:35,973
<i>whereas black hat... there's
no permission whatsoever,</i>

283
00:11:36,006 --> 00:11:39,680
<i>and it's usually for malicious purposes.</i>

284
00:11:39,713 --> 00:11:41,348
And then there's the middle ground,

285
00:11:41,382 --> 00:11:42,550
which is grey hat.

286
00:11:42,584 --> 00:11:46,090
<i>Hello, Evil Corp. We are fsociety.</i>

287
00:11:46,124 --> 00:11:48,194
<i>Over the years, we've been watching you:</i>

288
00:11:48,228 --> 00:11:50,199
<i>your financial abuse of the poor,</i>

289
00:11:50,233 --> 00:11:52,103
<i>your corruption of governments,</i>

290
00:11:52,137 --> 00:11:55,209
<i>your cover-ups of the murder
of innocent ordinary citizens</i>

291
00:11:55,242 --> 00:11:57,245
<i>all for the sake of profit.</i>

292
00:11:57,278 --> 00:12:00,852
<i>This is why we at fsociety
have decided you must die.</i>

293
00:12:00,886 --> 00:12:04,225
I would characterize the
members of fsociety

294
00:12:04,258 --> 00:12:06,796
<i>as probably falling into that grey area</i>

295
00:12:06,829 --> 00:12:09,602
<i>because, while their
intentions are good,</i>

296
00:12:09,635 --> 00:12:13,107
<i>they are doing highly illegal things.</i>

297
00:12:13,141 --> 00:12:14,843
The entire company's gonna be reeling

298
00:12:14,877 --> 00:12:16,815
from all the data dumps we've
got in store for them,

299
00:12:16,848 --> 00:12:18,151
and, man, do we have some goodies.

300
00:12:18,185 --> 00:12:20,287
Some good old-fashioned
executive racism,

301
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,324
sexism, fascism.

302
00:12:22,358 --> 00:12:24,395
Trust me... we are gonna
"ism" so much all over them,

303
00:12:24,429 --> 00:12:25,832
they won't be able to see straight.

304
00:12:29,103 --> 00:12:30,574
<i>Unlike their motives,</i>

305
00:12:30,607 --> 00:12:33,545
<i>there are many psychological
traits that hackers share.</i>

306
00:12:33,579 --> 00:12:35,615
Elliot, he's probably
depicted more accurate

307
00:12:35,648 --> 00:12:37,151
than I've seen in a long time,

308
00:12:37,185 --> 00:12:39,422
not just for the technical capabilities

309
00:12:39,457 --> 00:12:44,132
and how it is but the actual,
like, psychological profile.

310
00:12:44,166 --> 00:12:45,901
<i>He's got that young hacker vibe.</i>

311
00:12:45,935 --> 00:12:48,507
<i>And then his involvement in
how he feels about society</i>

312
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:51,212
<i>and that counter culture I
think is very accurate.</i>

313
00:12:51,246 --> 00:12:54,012
<i>I hate when I can't
hold in my loneliness.</i>

314
00:12:54,608 --> 00:12:56,344
<i>This crying's been happening too often,</i>

315
00:12:56,378 --> 00:12:58,214
<i>every other week now.</i>

316
00:12:58,248 --> 00:13:00,820
<i>What do normal people do
when they get this sad?</i>

317
00:13:00,853 --> 00:13:03,425
He's such a complicated character.

318
00:13:03,458 --> 00:13:05,896
<i>He's full of contradictions.</i>

319
00:13:05,929 --> 00:13:08,132
<i>He hates what society has become,</i>

320
00:13:08,166 --> 00:13:09,969
<i>but he also wants to save it.</i>

321
00:13:10,003 --> 00:13:13,176
He looks down on the people
that he cares about,

322
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:14,512
<i>but then he also protects them.</i>

323
00:13:14,546 --> 00:13:17,316
His abandonment issues
are actually something

324
00:13:17,349 --> 00:13:20,689
that I believe personally
and I've seen in my work.

325
00:13:20,723 --> 00:13:23,295
I think it is a big motivator
on why people get into hacking.

326
00:13:23,328 --> 00:13:25,331
<i>Elliot's, you know, trapped in a bubble.</i>

327
00:13:25,364 --> 00:13:26,767
He's very lonely. He doesn't know how

328
00:13:26,801 --> 00:13:29,873
to connect with people, so
he hacks into their lives.

329
00:13:29,907 --> 00:13:31,477
<i>I think all of us to a certain degree</i>

330
00:13:31,509 --> 00:13:33,812
<i>can connect with that
type of loneliness,</i>

331
00:13:33,847 --> 00:13:37,086
<i>and the need to maybe not be so robotic</i>

332
00:13:37,119 --> 00:13:39,991
and have more of a human
connection with one another.

333
00:13:40,025 --> 00:13:41,361
I like you, bro,

334
00:13:41,393 --> 00:13:44,132
and I want you to like me too.

335
00:13:44,166 --> 00:13:46,671
<i>Am I crazy not to like this guy?</i>

336
00:13:46,705 --> 00:13:48,340
<i>Amongst some of his Facebook likes</i>

337
00:13:48,373 --> 00:13:50,377
<i>are George W. Bush's "Decision Points,"</i>

338
00:13:50,411 --> 00:13:52,714
<i>"Transformers 2: Revenge of the Fallen,"</i>

339
00:13:52,748 --> 00:13:55,186
<i>and the music of Josh Groban.</i>

340
00:13:55,219 --> 00:13:57,892
<i>Must I really justify
myself any further?</i>

341
00:13:57,925 --> 00:13:59,328
<i>When you're socially awkward,</i>

342
00:13:59,362 --> 00:14:01,065
or you're worried about
people judging you,

343
00:14:01,098 --> 00:14:03,836
<i>you have all these anxieties
that just aren't there</i>

344
00:14:03,868 --> 00:14:05,404
<i>when you're in front of a computer.</i>

345
00:14:05,439 --> 00:14:06,709
<i>It's a lot harder to talk to people</i>

346
00:14:06,742 --> 00:14:08,812
<i>than it is to deal with
a piece of software.</i>

347
00:14:10,415 --> 00:14:12,084
<i>But when
hackers do come together</i>

348
00:14:12,118 --> 00:14:15,022
<i>and groups are formed, leaders emerge.</i>

349
00:14:15,056 --> 00:14:16,926
You want to talk about reality?

350
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:19,229
We haven't lived in anything
remotely close to it

351
00:14:19,263 --> 00:14:20,834
since the turn of the century.

352
00:14:20,868 --> 00:14:22,671
We turned it off, took
out the batteries,

353
00:14:22,704 --> 00:14:25,776
snacked on a bag of GMOs
while we tossed the remnants

354
00:14:25,810 --> 00:14:29,282
in the ever-expanding dumpster
of the human condition.

355
00:14:29,316 --> 00:14:32,589
We live in branded houses,
trademarked by corporations,

356
00:14:32,623 --> 00:14:35,128
built on bipolar numbers.

357
00:14:35,161 --> 00:14:36,863
<i>In every hacker group
there's this leader that,</i>

358
00:14:36,897 --> 00:14:38,499
<i>online they're quiet,</i>

359
00:14:38,533 --> 00:14:40,003
<i>they're hidden in the background,</i>

360
00:14:40,036 --> 00:14:42,339
but when you meet them they're
actually really extroverted

361
00:14:42,373 --> 00:14:44,744
and, like, passionate and principled.

362
00:14:44,777 --> 00:14:46,580
I didn't want to hurt you, Romero.

363
00:14:46,614 --> 00:14:48,719
I just wanted you to come
back to the arcade with me

364
00:14:48,752 --> 00:14:51,190
so we could change the world together.

365
00:14:51,223 --> 00:14:53,060
<i>It is this
instigator mentality</i>

366
00:14:53,094 --> 00:14:55,998
<i>that forms the basis of Mr.
Robot's character.</i>

367
00:14:56,032 --> 00:14:58,369
Do I think Elliot needs Mr. Robot?

368
00:14:58,403 --> 00:15:03,044
<i>I think he's a vital element
to Elliot's survival.</i>

369
00:15:03,079 --> 00:15:08,556
He is that darker side that
will sometimes do things

370
00:15:08,589 --> 00:15:12,695
that Elliot otherwise would
be incapable of doing.

371
00:15:12,729 --> 00:15:14,899
<i>Coming up, we'll
explore the eerie ways</i>

372
00:15:14,934 --> 00:15:17,606
<i>"Mr. Robot" parallels the real world.</i>

373
00:15:17,638 --> 00:15:19,575
The Sony hack got a lot of notoriety.

374
00:15:19,609 --> 00:15:21,345
<i>The Ashley Madison hack
got a lot of notoriety.</i>

375
00:15:21,378 --> 00:15:23,048
Our show is getting a lot of notoriety

376
00:15:23,081 --> 00:15:25,719
because of the real world connections.

377
00:15:25,753 --> 00:15:27,123
<i>Plus, we'll also discuss</i>

378
00:15:27,157 --> 00:15:28,859
<i>what's in store for season two.</i>

379
00:15:28,892 --> 00:15:32,065
<i>We kind of, like, press the
gas pedal down really hard.</i>

380
00:15:32,099 --> 00:15:34,435
<i>Gotten to know my stunt
double more this season,</i>

381
00:15:34,469 --> 00:15:36,840
so that might say something.

382
00:15:36,873 --> 00:15:38,945
<i>This is "Mr. Robot dec0d3d."</i>

383
00:15:41,183 --> 00:15:42,919
<i>"Mr. Robot's"
authentic portrayal</i>

384
00:15:42,953 --> 00:15:44,655
<i>of computer hacking has alerted us</i>

385
00:15:44,689 --> 00:15:47,594
<i>to the real-world dangers we all face.</i>

386
00:15:47,627 --> 00:15:51,901
<i>Now we'll find out just
how much we're at risk.</i>

387
00:15:51,935 --> 00:15:54,132
<i>This is "Mr. Robot dec0d3d."</i>

388
00:15:56,043 --> 00:15:58,782
This kid should not be
allowed to do what he did.

389
00:15:58,815 --> 00:16:01,854
He hacked into my private life.

390
00:16:01,887 --> 00:16:04,825
And then those Ashley
Madison dumps happened.

391
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:07,799
My wife found out about
everything anyway.

392
00:16:07,832 --> 00:16:08,933
She left me.

393
00:16:08,967 --> 00:16:10,135
<i>In a year
in which we've seen</i>

394
00:16:10,169 --> 00:16:12,272
<i>a record number of cyber attacks,</i>

395
00:16:12,307 --> 00:16:15,412
<i>"Mr. Robot's" timeliness
is almost uncanny.</i>

396
00:16:15,446 --> 00:16:16,849
I don't know that a TV show

397
00:16:16,881 --> 00:16:18,952
can necessarily predict the future,

398
00:16:18,986 --> 00:16:21,958
but certainly, they can hold a mirror up

399
00:16:21,991 --> 00:16:24,227
to the direction in which we're headed.

400
00:16:24,261 --> 00:16:25,664
<i>And while some storylines</i>

401
00:16:25,698 --> 00:16:27,467
<i>are ripped from the headlines,</i>

402
00:16:27,501 --> 00:16:30,439
<i>other times, "Mr.
Robot" was there first.</i>

403
00:16:30,472 --> 00:16:32,609
There were two instances on "Mr. Robot"

404
00:16:32,644 --> 00:16:36,717
where something incredibly
prophetic happened on the show

405
00:16:36,751 --> 00:16:40,392
weeks away from it
happening in real life.

406
00:16:40,425 --> 00:16:42,395
The Ashley Madison hacks were one.

407
00:16:42,429 --> 00:16:44,598
You know, one of the escorts was 15.

408
00:16:48,506 --> 00:16:51,612
And then the other one was the
shooting of the news anchor

409
00:16:51,645 --> 00:16:55,919
<i>in Virginia that happened
so close to a similar event</i>

410
00:16:55,953 --> 00:16:57,055
<i>happening on "Mr. Robot"</i>

411
00:16:57,089 --> 00:16:59,827
that the finale had to be delayed a week

412
00:16:59,861 --> 00:17:01,296
just out of sensitivity.

413
00:17:01,331 --> 00:17:03,836
These aren't just isolated incidences

414
00:17:03,869 --> 00:17:05,472
that exist in a bubble.

415
00:17:05,505 --> 00:17:08,611
These are things that are
symptoms of larger things

416
00:17:08,644 --> 00:17:09,980
going on in our society.

417
00:17:10,014 --> 00:17:12,184
<i>Colby either used hacking groups</i>

418
00:17:12,217 --> 00:17:14,121
<i>or worked in conjunction with them.</i>

419
00:17:14,153 --> 00:17:16,290
I think a lot of "Mr.
Robot" and the hacks in it

420
00:17:16,324 --> 00:17:17,693
<i>kind of reflect reality.</i>

421
00:17:17,727 --> 00:17:18,728
<i>It's happening, it's happening,</i>

422
00:17:18,763 --> 00:17:20,366
<i>it's happening, it's happening.</i>

423
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:23,671
The hacks that are happening
every week in the real world

424
00:17:23,705 --> 00:17:26,342
are stranger than fiction almost.

425
00:17:30,083 --> 00:17:31,786
<i>Power plants hacked,</i>

426
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:35,126
<i>a movie not released because
North Korea was upset,</i>

427
00:17:35,159 --> 00:17:36,763
<i>some of the biggest
retailers in the world</i>

428
00:17:36,796 --> 00:17:38,833
<i>lose millions and millions
worth of credit cards or data,</i>

429
00:17:38,865 --> 00:17:41,704
<i>hospitals shut down because
all their files got encrypted</i>

430
00:17:41,738 --> 00:17:43,708
<i>by someone trying to get
ransom out of them.</i>

431
00:17:43,742 --> 00:17:46,647
These all sound like the storylines

432
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:49,152
of a TV show about hacking,

433
00:17:49,186 --> 00:17:51,188
but it's actually happening now.

434
00:17:51,223 --> 00:17:53,861
"Secretary of Homeland
Security Jeh Johnson

435
00:17:53,893 --> 00:17:56,532
"released a statement today
stating that these groups

436
00:17:56,565 --> 00:18:00,072
"lack the resources and
knowledge of the USL

437
00:18:00,105 --> 00:18:04,012
to successfully mount
an attack," end quote.

438
00:18:04,046 --> 00:18:06,684
There are some brilliant
people out there,

439
00:18:06,717 --> 00:18:09,323
<i>both on the offense and
defensive side of things</i>

440
00:18:09,355 --> 00:18:12,294
that can do amazing
things with computers.

441
00:18:12,329 --> 00:18:14,032
You got this, you got
this, you got this.

442
00:18:14,064 --> 00:18:16,702
And it's both inspiring
and kind of scary

443
00:18:16,736 --> 00:18:17,838
sometimes to see that.

444
00:18:23,114 --> 00:18:26,153
I, uh... I have to go. I'm sorry.

445
00:18:26,187 --> 00:18:27,823
I need to go to my office.

446
00:18:27,856 --> 00:18:28,824
What'd you do?

447
00:18:28,859 --> 00:18:29,927
I spoofed a text

448
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:31,130
from her husband.

449
00:18:35,137 --> 00:18:38,476
So, yeah, probably the most
alarming hack we've seen

450
00:18:38,509 --> 00:18:41,114
was the Sony hack where
not only, you know,

451
00:18:41,148 --> 00:18:43,820
all of these email
archives were compromised,

452
00:18:43,852 --> 00:18:47,258
but also it was released
on a schedule of,

453
00:18:47,293 --> 00:18:50,131
you know, every week we're gonna
have another one of these,

454
00:18:50,165 --> 00:18:52,670
until you meet with our demands.

455
00:18:52,702 --> 00:18:54,672
<i>Another parallel
between "Mr. Robot"</i>

456
00:18:54,707 --> 00:18:58,045
<i>and the real world can be seen
in fsociety's threatened use</i>

457
00:18:58,079 --> 00:19:02,020
<i>of a data dump, a scenario
inspired by the Sony hack.</i>

458
00:19:02,054 --> 00:19:04,024
They hit the mother
lode during the breach,

459
00:19:04,057 --> 00:19:07,496
potentially terabytes
worth of email and files.

460
00:19:07,529 --> 00:19:10,134
They're threatening to dump everything.

461
00:19:10,169 --> 00:19:12,139
They released the video this morning.

462
00:19:12,171 --> 00:19:15,643
Meet our demands and we will
consider not destroying you.

463
00:19:15,678 --> 00:19:17,415
Consider yourself warned.

464
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:21,155
This is, you know, a way
to hold power accountable.

465
00:19:21,188 --> 00:19:24,896
It can also be used to
harass and to silence

466
00:19:24,929 --> 00:19:27,734
and really as an instrument of fear.

467
00:19:27,767 --> 00:19:29,670
<i>In an age where
everyone is connected,</i>

468
00:19:29,704 --> 00:19:32,610
<i>and privacy is becoming
harder to protect,</i>

469
00:19:32,643 --> 00:19:35,815
<i>"Mr. Robot" has shined a light
on the risks and the realities</i>

470
00:19:35,849 --> 00:19:38,019
<i>we all face every day.</i>

471
00:19:38,053 --> 00:19:40,157
The writers have tapped
into the paranoia

472
00:19:40,190 --> 00:19:42,126
that we all now feel,

473
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:45,934
that all of our information
is just ripe for the taking.

474
00:19:45,967 --> 00:19:48,037
He got into my system, and he
wants me to the put the CD

475
00:19:48,072 --> 00:19:49,542
on one of the computers at work.

476
00:19:49,574 --> 00:19:50,575
<i>Why does he want to do that?</i>

477
00:19:50,610 --> 00:19:52,647
I don't know, Stella.

478
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:54,150
He didn't give me a full explanation.

479
00:19:54,182 --> 00:19:55,552
<i>So he's got naked pics of me?</i>

480
00:19:55,585 --> 00:19:56,887
Is that the only thing you're seriously

481
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:58,290
taking away from this conversation?

482
00:20:00,963 --> 00:20:02,399
Hey, babe.

483
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:06,005
"Mr. Robot" is absolutely
showing everyone

484
00:20:06,037 --> 00:20:10,345
that we are living in
a society right now

485
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:13,485
<i>in which secrets just don't exist.</i>

486
00:20:13,517 --> 00:20:17,124
You maybe can't trust
many people at all.

487
00:20:17,158 --> 00:20:19,195
<i>I know she went through a
divorce four years ago.</i>

488
00:20:19,228 --> 00:20:20,664
<i>I know she was devastated by it</i>

489
00:20:20,698 --> 00:20:24,204
<i>and has been dating losers
on eHarmony ever since.</i>

490
00:20:24,237 --> 00:20:26,208
<i>The more accessible we make ourselves,</i>

491
00:20:26,242 --> 00:20:28,111
<i>the more people are
probably going to be able</i>

492
00:20:28,146 --> 00:20:29,983
<i>to take advantage of that.</i>

493
00:20:30,015 --> 00:20:33,455
By the end of watching
season one of "Mr. Robot,"

494
00:20:33,488 --> 00:20:37,895
anyone who previously just
typed away on a computer,

495
00:20:37,929 --> 00:20:40,501
you're probably going about
those transactions now

496
00:20:40,534 --> 00:20:44,242
with just a little more caution,

497
00:20:44,275 --> 00:20:45,945
<i>a little bit more of a realization</i>

498
00:20:45,978 --> 00:20:49,652
<i>that that little lock symbol
doesn't mean a whole lot.</i>

499
00:20:51,121 --> 00:20:53,726
<i>Our personal
information, our very identity,</i>

500
00:20:53,759 --> 00:20:56,898
<i>is accessible to anyone, any time,</i>

501
00:20:56,931 --> 00:20:58,901
<i>and we look to the
government to protect us</i>

502
00:20:58,936 --> 00:21:00,472
<i>from criminal activity,</i>

503
00:21:00,505 --> 00:21:03,010
<i>but a recent case between
Apple and the FBI,</i>

504
00:21:03,043 --> 00:21:05,448
<i>who are trying to unlock a
terrorist's cell phone,</i>

505
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:07,919
<i>brings up a gray area.</i>

506
00:21:07,952 --> 00:21:10,056
<i>Should the government be given access</i>

507
00:21:10,090 --> 00:21:11,793
<i>to your personal devices?</i>

508
00:21:11,826 --> 00:21:14,631
Telecommunications companies
have been cooperating

509
00:21:14,665 --> 00:21:16,835
with law enforcement and
intelligence agencies

510
00:21:16,869 --> 00:21:18,706
for nearly a century.

511
00:21:18,739 --> 00:21:22,044
And so you have the FBI saying

512
00:21:22,079 --> 00:21:25,284
"Oh, we can't hack into your iPhone.

513
00:21:25,317 --> 00:21:27,756
We need your help in doing it."

514
00:21:27,788 --> 00:21:30,860
And Apple is saying,
"Our stuff is so secure,

515
00:21:30,894 --> 00:21:34,568
it's a danger to everybody
if we help you out on this."

516
00:21:34,602 --> 00:21:37,239
NSA and the intelligence
community in general

517
00:21:37,273 --> 00:21:41,313
is focused on getting
intelligence wherever it can,

518
00:21:41,348 --> 00:21:45,021
<i>by any means possible, so
while they may be intending</i>

519
00:21:45,054 --> 00:21:47,959
to target someone associated
with a foreign government,

520
00:21:47,993 --> 00:21:50,296
or someone that they
suspect of terrorism,

521
00:21:50,330 --> 00:21:53,336
they're collecting your
communications to do so.

522
00:21:53,370 --> 00:21:54,872
<i>You would ask any person on the street,</i>

523
00:21:54,906 --> 00:21:58,011
<i>"Should the government be
able to hack into a phone</i>

524
00:21:58,044 --> 00:22:00,483
<i>to investigate a terrorism suspect?"</i>

525
00:22:00,515 --> 00:22:01,919
and everybody would say yes.

526
00:22:01,951 --> 00:22:03,755
And then, you ask them,
"Well, should they be able

527
00:22:03,788 --> 00:22:05,892
to hack into your phone?"
and everybody would say no.

528
00:22:05,927 --> 00:22:07,663
<i>We have to look really, really hard</i>

529
00:22:07,696 --> 00:22:09,833
<i>at the kind of slippery
slopes that we're building,</i>

530
00:22:09,867 --> 00:22:11,970
<i>as far as how much access the government</i>

531
00:22:12,004 --> 00:22:17,214
or any other corporation
has into our data.

532
00:22:17,246 --> 00:22:20,252
Any analyst at any time
can target anyone,

533
00:22:20,285 --> 00:22:23,257
from you or your accountant
to a federal judge

534
00:22:23,291 --> 00:22:26,397
to even the president, if
I had a personal email.

535
00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:28,734
Ben Franklin said it best:
"Those who give up liberty

536
00:22:28,767 --> 00:22:31,339
for security will have neither."

537
00:22:31,372 --> 00:22:33,744
<i>: Coming up: from
the tech to the techniques,</i>

538
00:22:33,776 --> 00:22:37,083
<i>see how "Mr. Robot" is
as real as it gets.</i>

539
00:22:37,117 --> 00:22:40,490
Every single hack that we
show on the show is possible.

540
00:22:40,524 --> 00:22:43,963
<i>Plus, we'll show you
what's in store for season two.</i>

541
00:22:43,996 --> 00:22:46,534
Our infinite loop of insanity.

542
00:22:46,567 --> 00:22:48,471
<i>This is "Mr. Robot dec0d3d."</i>

543
00:22:51,610 --> 00:22:53,747
<i>"Mr. Robot's"
authentic portrayal</i>

544
00:22:53,781 --> 00:22:58,556
<i>of computer hacking has alerted us to
the real-world dangers we all face.</i>

545
00:22:58,589 --> 00:23:02,797
<i>Now we'll find out just
how much we're at risk.</i>

546
00:23:02,830 --> 00:23:05,693
<i>This is "Mr. Robot dec0d3d."</i>

547
00:23:05,836 --> 00:23:07,839
Maybe we should consider rehab.

548
00:23:07,873 --> 00:23:09,143
I'm not a junkie.

549
00:23:09,177 --> 00:23:10,446
Then you'll need to prove it to me.

550
00:23:10,479 --> 00:23:13,183
Submit to a bi-monthly
drug test, voluntarily.

551
00:23:13,217 --> 00:23:15,521
That's the only way that
I'll recommend your release.

552
00:23:15,555 --> 00:23:17,424
<i>This is William Highsmith.</i>

553
00:23:17,459 --> 00:23:19,027
<i>He's not only the head of
the IT department here,</i>

554
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:21,230
<i>he's also an idiot.</i>

555
00:23:21,265 --> 00:23:23,402
<i>He uses useless virus
scans, dated servers,</i>

556
00:23:23,435 --> 00:23:27,042
<i>and security software
that runs on Windows 98.</i>

557
00:23:27,076 --> 00:23:28,546
<i>One of the reasons why I made this place</i>

558
00:23:28,578 --> 00:23:31,383
<i>my primary care facility.</i>

559
00:23:31,416 --> 00:23:33,119
<i>I can make my health records look like</i>

560
00:23:33,153 --> 00:23:36,559
<i>every other obedient zombie out there.</i>

561
00:23:36,594 --> 00:23:38,263
<i>"Mr. Robot's" popularity</i>

562
00:23:38,296 --> 00:23:40,333
<i>with many of its most fervent fans</i>

563
00:23:40,366 --> 00:23:42,971
<i>can largely be attributed
to its realistic portrayal</i>

564
00:23:43,005 --> 00:23:45,075
<i>of computer technology.</i>

565
00:23:45,108 --> 00:23:48,547
<i>That's the purview of technical
consultant Kor Adana.</i>

566
00:23:48,582 --> 00:23:49,818
I'm involved in every aspect

567
00:23:49,851 --> 00:23:51,354
of all the tech that
you see on the show.

568
00:23:51,386 --> 00:23:54,124
<i>I'm involved in pitching
the ideas of the hacks</i>

569
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:56,330
<i>that we see fsociety being a part of.</i>

570
00:23:56,364 --> 00:23:58,534
It's not your typical
tech consulting gig.

571
00:23:58,566 --> 00:24:01,873
Too many movies or TV shows

572
00:24:01,906 --> 00:24:04,210
try to make hacking just magic,

573
00:24:04,243 --> 00:24:05,779
and they don't explain it.

574
00:24:05,814 --> 00:24:07,417
<i>It's just something that
you can't understand,</i>

575
00:24:07,450 --> 00:24:09,621
<i>and because of that,
it's some superpower.</i>

576
00:24:09,654 --> 00:24:11,657
I think one of the greatest
compliments we can get

577
00:24:11,691 --> 00:24:15,131
is just how realistic and
authentic the show actually

578
00:24:15,163 --> 00:24:17,268
<i>portrays what's really
going on out there.</i>

579
00:24:17,302 --> 00:24:18,938
One of the things that's
so great about the show

580
00:24:18,971 --> 00:24:21,410
is that you'll actually
learn a few things.

581
00:24:21,442 --> 00:24:24,481
This is bad, worst DDoS
attack I've ever seen.

582
00:24:24,515 --> 00:24:27,520
<i>DDoS attacks are a bunch of
hackers getting together</i>

583
00:24:27,554 --> 00:24:30,526
to overload a system to
take it down for, you know,

584
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:32,329
a temporary amount of time.

585
00:24:32,363 --> 00:24:33,966
<i>It's a flood of traffic.</i>

586
00:24:33,999 --> 00:24:36,201
<i>We're sending signals over wires,</i>

587
00:24:36,236 --> 00:24:38,507
and if you have too many
signals at the same time,

588
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:40,009
the real signal can't get through.

589
00:24:40,044 --> 00:24:42,381
Tried to reboot the servers, but
they're not coming back up.

590
00:24:42,414 --> 00:24:43,951
Dude, someone is straight
up finger blasting

591
00:24:43,985 --> 00:24:45,254
their entire network right now.

592
00:24:45,287 --> 00:24:47,991
I've learned quite a
bit, maybe too much.

593
00:24:48,025 --> 00:24:52,733
It's kind of scary, mm, what
I'm capable of these days.

594
00:24:52,767 --> 00:24:54,769
<i>For the
creators and fans alike,</i>

595
00:24:54,804 --> 00:24:56,708
<i>there's an appreciation that the realism</i>

596
00:24:56,741 --> 00:24:58,043
<i>lies in the details.</i>

597
00:24:58,076 --> 00:25:00,749
People are screen-capturing the images

598
00:25:00,781 --> 00:25:02,217
on the computer screens,

599
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:04,520
and looking at them to
see if they're real.

600
00:25:04,555 --> 00:25:07,760
<i>And they are real, and
that takes a lot of time.</i>

601
00:25:07,795 --> 00:25:09,465
<i>One screenshot that was shown, I think,</i>

602
00:25:09,499 --> 00:25:12,871
<i>for less than a second took
somebody over ten hours of work</i>

603
00:25:12,903 --> 00:25:15,909
to make that an authentic
load-up sequence.

604
00:25:15,942 --> 00:25:19,215
All of the screens are
designed, essentially, by me,

605
00:25:19,249 --> 00:25:21,654
and I work with animators
to achieve those

606
00:25:21,688 --> 00:25:24,559
<i>and make sure that they're
technically accurate.</i>

607
00:25:24,592 --> 00:25:26,329
<i>I think details like that</i>

608
00:25:26,363 --> 00:25:28,868
really enriches and deepens the world.

609
00:25:28,901 --> 00:25:31,506
<i>It makes the show this
almost alternate reality</i>

610
00:25:31,538 --> 00:25:34,877
that's not too detached from our own.

611
00:25:34,912 --> 00:25:36,547
<i>More than just imagery,</i>

612
00:25:36,581 --> 00:25:39,887
<i>"Mr. Robot's" realism extends
to the schemes and methods</i>

613
00:25:39,921 --> 00:25:42,926
<i>that are currently in use
by the hacking community.</i>

614
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:46,098
<i>Their ability to infiltrate and
alter a physical environment</i>

615
00:25:46,133 --> 00:25:48,638
<i>was illustrated by the
Steel Mountain hack,</i>

616
00:25:48,671 --> 00:25:50,673
<i>a scenario that closely paralleled</i>

617
00:25:50,707 --> 00:25:55,181
<i>one of history's most famous
cyber attacks, Stuxnet.</i>

618
00:25:55,216 --> 00:25:58,688
The US and Israel had a joint operation

619
00:25:58,721 --> 00:26:03,062
<i>where they created an
amazingly complex program</i>

620
00:26:03,096 --> 00:26:05,634
that hacked into the computers

621
00:26:05,668 --> 00:26:08,407
<i>controlling the speed with which</i>

622
00:26:08,441 --> 00:26:11,579
<i>centrifuges were spinning
in the plant in Iran</i>

623
00:26:11,613 --> 00:26:13,181
<i>that was enriching uranium.</i>

624
00:26:13,216 --> 00:26:16,989
And about half of Iran's
centrifuges were destroyed.

625
00:26:17,022 --> 00:26:21,597
It probably slowed down their
nuclear program by three years.

626
00:26:21,632 --> 00:26:24,070
To think about the steps
that are required

627
00:26:24,103 --> 00:26:26,841
<i>to plan that and then
causing kinetic damage,</i>

628
00:26:26,874 --> 00:26:28,177
is incredible.

629
00:26:28,210 --> 00:26:29,912
He wants to hack Steel Mountain's

630
00:26:29,947 --> 00:26:31,650
climate control system,

631
00:26:31,682 --> 00:26:33,452
raise the facility's heat high enough

632
00:26:33,487 --> 00:26:36,057
to destroy all the tapes.

633
00:26:36,091 --> 00:26:38,061
And you think sticking
this behind the thermostat

634
00:26:38,095 --> 00:26:39,096
will do all that?

635
00:26:39,131 --> 00:26:41,768
From a authenticity standpoint,

636
00:26:41,802 --> 00:26:44,006
if you wanted to hack
a major corporation,

637
00:26:44,039 --> 00:26:46,978
<i>they would have off-site tape backups</i>

638
00:26:47,010 --> 00:26:50,316
at a location like Steel Mountain.

639
00:26:50,351 --> 00:26:53,056
There. Deep in the Adirondacks.

640
00:26:53,088 --> 00:26:56,394
In 145-plus acre former limestone mine.

641
00:26:56,429 --> 00:27:00,937
3-ton steel gates, 24/7 armed guards,

642
00:27:00,970 --> 00:27:03,776
closed circuit cameras, NOC staffing.

643
00:27:03,808 --> 00:27:06,314
A fair amount of the plots
and techniques and the hacks

644
00:27:06,347 --> 00:27:07,983
and the approaches in "Mr. Robot"

645
00:27:08,017 --> 00:27:09,320
are actually plausible.

646
00:27:09,353 --> 00:27:10,321
The reason they're plausible:

647
00:27:10,354 --> 00:27:11,824
it's 90% preparation

648
00:27:11,856 --> 00:27:13,492
and only 10% execution.

649
00:27:13,527 --> 00:27:15,497
<i>There's a fair amount
of understanding how</i>

650
00:27:15,529 --> 00:27:16,966
<i>the other systems and the targets</i>

651
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,703
<i>that you're focusing on work,</i>

652
00:27:18,737 --> 00:27:21,342
<i>and then having your, you know,</i>

653
00:27:21,374 --> 00:27:23,345
<i>system and your hack ready</i>

654
00:27:23,379 --> 00:27:25,917
so that you can execute it, you
know, when the time is right.

655
00:27:25,950 --> 00:27:29,221
All we need is one security flaw.

656
00:27:29,256 --> 00:27:32,729
Look at this place, man. It
was built not to have any.

657
00:27:34,566 --> 00:27:38,673
I see about... six walking around.

658
00:27:38,707 --> 00:27:40,677
<i>Social engineering
is one example of</i>

659
00:27:40,710 --> 00:27:42,514
<i>a real-world hacking method,</i>

660
00:27:42,547 --> 00:27:45,451
<i>and "Mr. Robot" illustrates
it to perfection.</i>

661
00:27:45,486 --> 00:27:48,458
The social engineering
component of hacking, I think,

662
00:27:48,490 --> 00:27:51,696
is one of the most
important aspects of it.

663
00:27:51,730 --> 00:27:55,371
<i>Taking advantage of that
human element of security.</i>

664
00:27:55,403 --> 00:27:57,842
Bill Harper is our first exploit.

665
00:27:57,874 --> 00:27:59,178
He isn't gonna give the
search much scrutiny.

666
00:27:59,210 --> 00:28:00,378
He'll get us to Level 1,

667
00:28:00,412 --> 00:28:01,782
but Bill is not gonna be
able to get us to Level 2.

668
00:28:01,816 --> 00:28:03,787
And we need to get to Level 2.

669
00:28:03,819 --> 00:28:06,457
You're gonna ask to speak
to his supervisor, Wendy.

670
00:28:06,491 --> 00:28:08,528
She'll get us to exactly
where we need to be.

671
00:28:08,562 --> 00:28:10,732
Then we'll be able to get
rid of her from the van.

672
00:28:10,766 --> 00:28:12,936
After that, you connect the Raspberry Pi

673
00:28:12,970 --> 00:28:15,408
to the climate control system,
and Bob's your uncle.

674
00:28:15,441 --> 00:28:18,346
<i>It doesn't matter how
hardened your system is,</i>

675
00:28:18,381 --> 00:28:20,584
<i>how great your security policies are,</i>

676
00:28:20,617 --> 00:28:22,787
what kind of software you
have on your system.

677
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:24,957
There's always gonna be a human

678
00:28:24,991 --> 00:28:27,629
that has access to information
that's important.

679
00:28:27,663 --> 00:28:31,471
And you can always find a way
to manipulate that person.

680
00:28:31,505 --> 00:28:32,774
People are all just people, right?

681
00:28:32,806 --> 00:28:34,343
When it gets down to it,
everyone's the same.

682
00:28:34,375 --> 00:28:35,478
They love something.

683
00:28:35,511 --> 00:28:36,713
They want something.
They fear something.

684
00:28:36,747 --> 00:28:38,182
Specifics help, but
specifics don't change

685
00:28:38,216 --> 00:28:39,686
the way that everyone is vulnerable.

686
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:44,127
It just changes the way that we
access those vulnerabilities.

687
00:28:44,161 --> 00:28:45,729
Great example of this is

688
00:28:45,764 --> 00:28:49,338
<i>Elliot impersonating a
multi-million-dollar CEO</i>

689
00:28:49,371 --> 00:28:50,573
to get through the door.

690
00:28:50,605 --> 00:28:53,711
I really think you should look me up.

691
00:28:53,746 --> 00:28:55,883
It... it just doesn't work like that.

692
00:28:55,915 --> 00:28:57,251
I'm sorry, sir.

693
00:28:57,286 --> 00:29:00,258
<i>You impersonate someone
that is in need of</i>

694
00:29:00,290 --> 00:29:01,893
<i>some kind of help or assistance,</i>

695
00:29:01,928 --> 00:29:03,898
most of the time, they'll
want to help you.

696
00:29:03,931 --> 00:29:05,299
Mr. Sepiol?

697
00:29:05,333 --> 00:29:06,569
Mr. Sepiol!

698
00:29:06,603 --> 00:29:08,406
I have some good news.

699
00:29:08,439 --> 00:29:11,411
<i>And that's why Bill Harper
is a perfect exploit,</i>

700
00:29:11,444 --> 00:29:13,781
<i>desperate enough for the
business to break protocol</i>

701
00:29:13,816 --> 00:29:16,854
<i>and let me in.</i>

702
00:29:16,887 --> 00:29:18,924
<i>Lonely enough to break.</i>

703
00:29:18,959 --> 00:29:20,260
They won't even know
that they're giving you

704
00:29:20,294 --> 00:29:22,098
some kind of information
that will help you

705
00:29:22,132 --> 00:29:24,503
hack their system later.

706
00:29:24,536 --> 00:29:26,573
But it happens all the time.

707
00:29:26,605 --> 00:29:28,942
<i>Coming up on "Mr.
Robot dec0d3d,"</i>

708
00:29:28,977 --> 00:29:31,582
<i>we delve into the ethics of hacktivism.</i>

709
00:29:31,615 --> 00:29:33,585
If you feel that there is injustice,

710
00:29:33,618 --> 00:29:35,721
sometimes the only way to deal with it

711
00:29:35,756 --> 00:29:38,761
is to out-monster the monster.

712
00:29:38,795 --> 00:29:40,265
<i>Plus, we'll also discuss</i>

713
00:29:40,297 --> 00:29:42,268
<i>what's in store for season two.</i>

714
00:29:42,302 --> 00:29:44,406
<i>This is "Mr. Robot dec0d3d."</i>

715
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:48,637
<i>"Mr. Robot's"

716
00:29:48,672 --> 00:29:52,176
<i>of computer hacking has alerted us to
the real-world dangers we all face.</i>

717
00:29:52,211 --> 00:29:56,184
<i>Now, we'll find out just
how much we're at risk.</i>

718
00:29:56,218 --> 00:29:59,991
<i>This is "Mr. Robot dec0d3d."</i>

719
00:30:00,345 --> 00:30:02,250
You're blowing up a gas pipeline.

720
00:30:02,275 --> 00:30:04,625
The world is a dangerous place, Elliot.

721
00:30:04,650 --> 00:30:06,153
Not because of those who do evil,

722
00:30:06,186 --> 00:30:08,791
but because of those who
look on and do nothing.

723
00:30:08,824 --> 00:30:10,527
This is war. People will die.

724
00:30:10,561 --> 00:30:12,698
<i>C'est la mort.</i>

725
00:30:12,733 --> 00:30:15,037
I'm not killing anyone.

726
00:30:17,293 --> 00:30:19,263
Tell me one thing, Elliot.

727
00:30:19,296 --> 00:30:22,767
Are you a one or a zero?

728
00:30:22,802 --> 00:30:24,906
That's the question you
have to ask yourself.

729
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:26,910
Are you a yes or a no?

730
00:30:26,943 --> 00:30:29,481
Are you gonna act or not?

731
00:30:29,515 --> 00:30:34,658
Hacktivism is the act of
compromising a computer system

732
00:30:34,690 --> 00:30:38,363
or a network with a
political agenda in mind.

733
00:30:38,398 --> 00:30:40,969
<i>One of the reasons for "Mr.
Robot's" huge success</i>

734
00:30:41,002 --> 00:30:43,005
<i>is that it speaks to the
current generation's</i>

735
00:30:43,038 --> 00:30:45,075
<i>distrust of our corporate culture</i>

736
00:30:45,110 --> 00:30:48,082
<i>and to their frustration
with the status quo.</i>

737
00:30:48,115 --> 00:30:52,324
<i>But is taking matters into our
own hands ever justified?</i>

738
00:30:52,356 --> 00:30:54,594
In many cases, hacktivism
takes the form of

739
00:30:54,627 --> 00:30:56,663
anti-establishment points of view.

740
00:30:56,698 --> 00:30:59,769
<i>The governments of the world
and their corporate masters</i>

741
00:30:59,804 --> 00:31:02,409
<i>do not want us to speak. Why?</i>

742
00:31:02,441 --> 00:31:03,979
<i>Because we unlock truths.</i>

743
00:31:04,011 --> 00:31:05,513
<i>We expose villains.</i>

744
00:31:05,547 --> 00:31:08,186
<i>If you have any interest in
waking from your slumber</i>

745
00:31:08,219 --> 00:31:11,325
<i>and retrieving lost,
damaged, or stolen memory,</i>

746
00:31:11,357 --> 00:31:12,760
<i>we are here for you.</i>

747
00:31:12,795 --> 00:31:14,064
<i>We have your back.</i>

748
00:31:14,096 --> 00:31:16,868
<i>We are fsociety.</i>

749
00:31:16,902 --> 00:31:19,707
A lot of fsociety and
the mask is obviously

750
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:21,610
<i>evocative of Anonymous</i>

751
00:31:21,643 --> 00:31:23,113
<i>and the Guy Fawkes mask</i>

752
00:31:23,146 --> 00:31:26,118
<i>that a lot of people in
Anonymous started to wear</i>

753
00:31:26,152 --> 00:31:27,921
back when they had
their campaign against

754
00:31:27,956 --> 00:31:30,260
the Church of Scientology.

755
00:31:30,293 --> 00:31:32,864
<i>Their declaration of war on Scientology</i>

756
00:31:32,899 --> 00:31:35,102
definitely served as an inspiration

757
00:31:35,135 --> 00:31:38,508
for some of the content that
you see on "Mr. Robot."

758
00:31:38,542 --> 00:31:40,913
<i>Corporate greed is a trickle-down desire</i>

759
00:31:40,947 --> 00:31:43,319
<i>that reaches even the
bottom of the food chain.</i>

760
00:31:43,352 --> 00:31:45,188
<i>And for what? Wealth? Power?</i>

761
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:46,355
What the shit?

762
00:31:46,390 --> 00:31:47,959
<i>It's a pathetic fable,</i>

763

<i>and you, Allsafe, are a defender of...</i>

764
00:31:50,465 --> 00:31:52,401
Holy shit. fsociety knows us.

765
00:31:52,433 --> 00:31:53,737
<i>But your sweet dream is over</i>

766
00:31:53,769 --> 00:31:56,407
<i>and your nightmare is about to begin.</i>

767
00:31:56,441 --> 00:31:59,780
<i>Gideon Goddard, you are a lackey</i>

768
00:31:59,815 --> 00:32:01,250
<i>to your corporate overlords...</i>

00:32:01,284 --> 00:32:02,821
Someone shut this off.

770
00:32:02,854 --> 00:32:05,525
<i>Serving them, slave to master.</i>

771
00:32:05,557 --> 00:32:07,461
<i>We are exposing your role to your world,</i>

772

<i>and the world is very angry.</i>

773
00:32:11,169 --> 00:32:14,041
I have a very anti-corporate,
anti-establishment spirit

774
00:32:14,075 --> 00:32:17,213
in me, and as much as I
appreciate Occupy Wall Street,

775
00:32:17,247 --> 00:32:20,385
I think as an adult I
want to use that anger

776
00:32:20,420 --> 00:32:23,792
to actually do something
constructive and positive.

777
00:32:23,825 --> 00:32:26,530
And I think, like, for
example, the Arab Spring

778
00:32:26,564 --> 00:32:28,167
<i>is a good example where</i>

779
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:30,838
<i>they really kind of got empowered</i>

780
00:32:30,872 --> 00:32:32,007
<i>through social media, actually,</i>

781
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:33,008
<i>through technology,</i>

782
00:32:33,043 --> 00:32:35,013
and really made change.

783
00:32:36,583 --> 00:32:39,889
<i>The Arab Spring is a
really good example of</i>

784
00:32:39,922 --> 00:32:41,726
<i>security in action.</i>

785
00:32:41,758 --> 00:32:44,229
If you're an activist in Bahrain,

786
00:32:44,263 --> 00:32:46,835
you need your email, you
need your Facebook account

787
00:32:46,867 --> 00:32:49,439
to be secure, because if the government,

788
00:32:49,473 --> 00:32:51,609
which controls all the
Internet infrastructure,

789
00:32:51,642 --> 00:32:53,779
<i>can get in, that's it, you're done.</i>

790
00:32:53,814 --> 00:32:54,916
They're gonna take... come to your house

791
00:32:54,950 --> 00:32:56,152
and put a bag over your head

792
00:32:56,184 --> 00:32:57,988
and no one will ever see you again.

793
00:32:58,021 --> 00:32:59,190
Now whatever it is you
think you're doing

794
00:32:59,225 --> 00:33:00,961
freeing the world, freeing the masses,

795
00:33:00,994 --> 00:33:02,964
the guys I work for,
they ain't motivated by

796
00:33:02,998 --> 00:33:04,601
"Kumbaya" shit like that.

797
00:33:04,633 --> 00:33:06,170
<i>Right and wrong is relative,</i>

798
00:33:06,203 --> 00:33:10,044
and it comes down to your own ideology,

799
00:33:10,077 --> 00:33:11,681
your own moral compass,

800
00:33:11,713 --> 00:33:15,320
and whether or not you feel
passionate enough about that

801
00:33:15,354 --> 00:33:18,727
to act on it.

802
00:33:18,759 --> 00:33:22,132
How come I'm not in trouble?

803
00:33:25,773 --> 00:33:28,512
Even though what you did was wrong,

804
00:33:28,546 --> 00:33:32,719
you're still a good kid.

805
00:33:32,752 --> 00:33:34,556
And that guy was a prick.

806
00:33:34,590 --> 00:33:36,961
Sometimes that matters more.

807
00:33:36,994 --> 00:33:39,031
I think the reason it
thematically resonates

808
00:33:39,065 --> 00:33:41,570
with people when you're watching
a show like "Mr. Robot,"

809
00:33:41,603 --> 00:33:43,105
if the antagonist is strong enough

810
00:33:43,139 --> 00:33:45,242
or if you feel that there is injustice

811
00:33:45,276 --> 00:33:46,378
coming from the antagonist,

812
00:33:46,412 --> 00:33:49,249
if there's an injustice in the world...

813
00:33:49,283 --> 00:33:51,554
sometimes the only way to deal with it

814
00:33:51,587 --> 00:33:54,892
is to out-monster the monster.

815
00:33:54,927 --> 00:33:56,830
<i>Fernando Vera, Shayla's supplier</i>

816
00:33:56,863 --> 00:33:59,035
<i>and one of the worst human
beings I've ever hacked.</i>

817
00:33:59,068 --> 00:34:00,537
<i>He does all his drug transactions</i>

818
00:34:00,571 --> 00:34:03,376
<i>through emails, IMs, Twitter.</i>

819
00:34:03,409 --> 00:34:06,214
<i>He can't be allowed to exist anymore.</i>

820
00:34:06,247 --> 00:34:08,251
<i>When you break down
motivations of hackers,</i>

821
00:34:08,285 --> 00:34:11,089
<i>it's money, ideology, coercion, ego,</i>

822
00:34:11,123 --> 00:34:13,227
or revenge, and sometimes
criss and cross.

823
00:34:13,261 --> 00:34:14,430
<i>In "Mr. Robot,"</i>

824
00:34:14,464 --> 00:34:16,299
<i>Elliot's ideology is founded on</i>

825
00:34:16,332 --> 00:34:19,538
<i>his desire to avenge his father's death.</i>

826
00:34:19,574 --> 00:34:22,079
This isn't even about my revolution.

827
00:34:22,111 --> 00:34:24,013
This is more than that for you.

828
00:34:24,047 --> 00:34:26,986
This is about how those bastards
slowly killed your father

829
00:34:27,021 --> 00:34:28,523
and how you wished he'd
done something about it,

830
00:34:28,555 --> 00:34:29,523
but he didn't

831
00:34:29,556 --> 00:34:31,526
because he was a zero,

832
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:33,464
just like you're being right now.

833
00:34:33,498 --> 00:34:35,636
It's just a basic question of, you know,

834
00:34:35,669 --> 00:34:38,941
when does the good outweigh
the bad and vice versa?

835
00:34:38,975 --> 00:34:42,214
You know, the very massive
ethical questions

836
00:34:42,247 --> 00:34:44,183
that this show will pose.

837
00:34:44,218 --> 00:34:47,859
<i>We hope that you will
forge a better world,</i>

838
00:34:47,892 --> 00:34:51,230
<i>a world that belongs to us again!</i>

839
00:34:52,801 --> 00:34:56,273
We'll see if Elliot and
everybody in fsociety...

840
00:34:56,306 --> 00:34:58,879
are saving the world or destroying it.

841
00:34:58,912 --> 00:35:01,248
<i>Coming up, could
a small group of hackers</i>

842
00:35:01,283 --> 00:35:03,754
<i>actually change the world overnight?</i>

843
00:35:03,788 --> 00:35:06,025
It's not a fantasy. It's
not science fiction.

844
00:35:06,059 --> 00:35:09,398
<i>Plus, we'll show you
what's in store for season two.</i>

845
00:35:09,430 --> 00:35:12,235
Amen, amen, amen!

846
00:35:12,271 --> 00:35:14,910
<i>This is "Mr. Robot dec0d3d."</i>

847
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:21,611
<i>Evil Corp, you have been owned.</i>

848
00:35:21,798 --> 00:35:25,237
<i>We at fsociety will smile</i>

849
00:35:25,271 --> 00:35:29,512
<i>as we watch you and your dark soul die.</i>

850
00:35:30,664 --> 00:35:32,642
<i>USA Network's "Mr. Robot" is</i>

851
00:35:32,677 --> 00:35:33,979
<i>groundbreaking television,</i>

852
00:35:34,012 --> 00:35:35,782
<i>with cutting edge storylines,</i>

853
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:37,516
<i>detailed world building,</i>

854
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:40,311
<i>and uncanny parallels to current events.</i>

855
00:35:40,345 --> 00:35:42,548
<i>Certainly a subject
matter that has become</i>

856
00:35:42,581 --> 00:35:46,522
more and more relevant as...
as the year has gone on.

857
00:35:46,557 --> 00:35:48,827
<i>Markets in Asia and Europe
are tumbling dramatically.</i>

858
00:35:48,861 --> 00:35:50,631
<i>Numerous governments
in the European Union</i>

859
00:35:50,664 --> 00:35:51,934
<i>are now in a free-for-all.</i>

860
00:35:51,968 --> 00:35:53,303
<i>So this is what our evolution</i>

861
00:35:53,336 --> 00:35:55,740
<i>Looks like: a simple program,</i>

862
00:35:55,774 --> 00:35:58,479
<i>a worm that can make data unreadable.</i>

863
00:35:58,513 --> 00:36:01,685
<i>Is that really all it
takes to kill the world?</i>

864
00:36:01,718 --> 00:36:03,287
<i>But could the fsociety hack</i>

865
00:36:03,321 --> 00:36:05,727
<i>portrayed in the show actually happen?</i>

866
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:08,531
<i>What would the fallout of
such a hack look like?</i>

867
00:36:08,564 --> 00:36:10,935
So we have plenty of companies
that kind of fall into that

868
00:36:10,968 --> 00:36:13,272
"too big to fail" moniker.

869
00:36:13,307 --> 00:36:15,276
<i>It's kind of scary to think about</i>

870
00:36:15,310 --> 00:36:17,749
what the impact of a
destructive hack against them

871
00:36:17,781 --> 00:36:19,417
could have on... on society.

872
00:36:19,450 --> 00:36:24,327
You could wreck large
sectors of the power grid.

873
00:36:24,361 --> 00:36:27,935
<i>You could take down a whole bank.</i>

874
00:36:27,968 --> 00:36:30,071
<i>You could do a lot of damage.</i>

875
00:36:30,104 --> 00:36:32,341
There are some key vulnerabilities

876
00:36:32,374 --> 00:36:33,844
within our national infrastructure.

877
00:36:33,879 --> 00:36:36,182
<i>People could actually take
the entire Internet down.</i>

878
00:36:36,216 --> 00:36:39,355
A lone hacker really
can do immense damage,

879
00:36:39,388 --> 00:36:40,824
or they can do immense good.

880
00:36:40,858 --> 00:36:42,660
It's just all in the motivation.

881
00:36:42,693 --> 00:36:43,963
I think it'd be possible.

882
00:36:43,997 --> 00:36:46,167
Are there ramifications to that?

883
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:47,436
Of course.

884
00:36:47,470 --> 00:36:48,872
<i>Are there ramifications to that</i>

885
00:36:48,905 --> 00:36:51,743
<i>that fsociety and Elliot
didn't even think of?</i>

886
00:36:51,778 --> 00:36:53,982
<i>Definitely. And we're
gonna get into that</i>

887
00:36:54,015 --> 00:36:54,983
<i>in season two.</i>

888
00:36:55,017 --> 00:36:55,985
There's gonna be, I bet,

889
00:36:56,019 --> 00:36:57,522
a lot of people coming for them.

890
00:36:57,555 --> 00:36:59,525
You know, law enforcement's
gonna be coming in season two.

891
00:36:59,559 --> 00:37:00,727
It has to.

892
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:02,363
<i>Season two of "Mr.
Robot" will</i>

893
00:37:02,397 --> 00:37:04,568
<i>go deeper into this amazing world,</i>

894
00:37:04,602 --> 00:37:06,939
<i>as the characters deal
with the repercussions of</i>

895
00:37:06,972 --> 00:37:08,408
<i>the Evil Corp hack.</i>

896
00:37:08,441 --> 00:37:09,877
So we come back in season two

897
00:37:09,910 --> 00:37:11,280
and the hack has gone through

898
00:37:11,314 --> 00:37:13,139
and kind of destroyed the world.

899
00:37:13,211 --> 00:37:14,648
<i>The FBI announced today,</i>

900
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:16,318
<i>and we can confirm that</i>

901
00:37:16,352 --> 00:37:19,959
<i>fsociety engaged in this attack.</i>

902
00:37:19,992 --> 00:37:22,062
Now that Elliot knows who Mr. Robot is,

903
00:37:22,095 --> 00:37:24,766
it's very different from last year.

904
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:27,071
<i>What he's trying to do at all costs</i>

905
00:37:27,104 --> 00:37:30,077
<i>is to remove him from his world.</i>

906
00:37:30,111 --> 00:37:32,381
In the second season, the
story really picks up

907
00:37:32,414 --> 00:37:34,050
and... and moves forward.

908
00:37:34,084 --> 00:37:35,687
You know, we set up all the characters,

909
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:38,024
<i>and now really in the second
season we're really kind of</i>

910
00:37:38,057 --> 00:37:39,960
<i>letting all those characters run wild.</i>

911
00:37:39,995 --> 00:37:42,967
We're really going into
an ensemble sort of

912
00:37:42,999 --> 00:37:44,269
version of the show.

913
00:37:44,303 --> 00:37:46,273
<i>We're in four or five different worlds</i>

914
00:37:46,307 --> 00:37:47,542
<i>at the same time.</i>

915
00:37:47,575 --> 00:37:50,547
Just watching that
struggle and seeing people

916
00:37:50,581 --> 00:37:53,120
<i>at the end of their rope still persevere</i>

917
00:37:53,153 --> 00:37:54,722
and continue to fight,

918
00:37:54,754 --> 00:37:57,260
<i>even though their back's
against the wall.</i>

919
00:38:01,535 --> 00:38:02,653
<i>In the second season,</i>

920
00:38:02,701 --> 00:38:04,504
<i>all the characters have sort of evolved.</i>

921
00:38:04,538 --> 00:38:06,209
<i>The world is very different.</i>

922
00:38:06,241 --> 00:38:08,312
Expect to be a little surprised

923
00:38:08,346 --> 00:38:10,984
because we're going down a
very different direction

924
00:38:11,017 --> 00:38:13,154
than the road we went
down in season one.

925
00:38:13,187 --> 00:38:15,157
<i>And Sam has got it really mapped out.</i>

926
00:38:15,192 --> 00:38:16,527
When I was reading these scripts,

927
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:18,330
and I was just saying, "Oh, my God."

928
00:38:18,364 --> 00:38:21,402
There's these clues that you
kind of strand together.

929
00:38:21,435 --> 00:38:23,073
I mean, we were like, Reddit people

930
00:38:23,107 --> 00:38:25,076
discussing with each other
what we thought would happen.

931
00:38:25,109 --> 00:38:26,912
He comes up with some crazy stuff.

932
00:38:34,259 --> 00:38:37,131
I don't know what I'm supposed to do.

933
00:38:37,165 --> 00:38:39,670
<i>I'll tell you exactly
what you're gonna do.</i>

934
00:38:39,703 --> 00:38:42,609
<i>You're gonna start listening to us.</i>

935
00:38:42,642 --> 00:38:45,214
<i>The world is a better place
because of what we did, Elliot,</i>

936
00:38:45,247 --> 00:38:47,984
<i>and you're gonna realize
that one way or another.</i>

937
00:38:48,018 --> 00:38:51,024
<i>Now here's what I need you to do now.</i>

938
00:38:51,672 --> 00:38:53,942
<i>So what has "Mr. Robot" taught us?</i>

939
00:38:53,978 --> 00:38:56,883
Working with the tech advisor
has got me to change the way

940
00:38:56,918 --> 00:38:58,586
I conduct myself.

941
00:38:58,619 --> 00:38:59,922
Someone actually asked me the other day

942
00:38:59,955 --> 00:39:01,525
if I wanted to hack them, could I?

943
00:39:01,559 --> 00:39:03,028
Unfortunately, the answer was no,

944
00:39:03,061 --> 00:39:04,764
and I really wish it was yes.

945
00:39:04,798 --> 00:39:07,169
I tend to be paranoid
about my own information.

946
00:39:07,202 --> 00:39:08,604
My drives, my phone.

947
00:39:08,637 --> 00:39:11,576
The microphone you have on
your computer can be accessed.

948
00:39:11,609 --> 00:39:13,312
The camera, as much
as people don't think

949
00:39:13,346 --> 00:39:15,248
it can be accessed, it can.

950
00:39:15,283 --> 00:39:17,755
I tell other people to tape
the camera on their laptop.

951
00:39:17,789 --> 00:39:20,294
Oh, yeah, put the piece
of tape on your laptop.

952
00:39:20,326 --> 00:39:21,962
Absolutely a must.

953
00:39:21,996 --> 00:39:25,168
I was literally actually about
to get tape and do that.

954
00:39:25,202 --> 00:39:25,825
That's great.

955
00:39:25,850 --> 00:39:28,285
I've infected my paranoia with everyone.
