1
00:01:06,866 --> 00:01:08,026
Are you wet?

2
00:01:15,775 --> 00:01:16,935
Aren't you?

3
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:19,238
What are you talking about?

4
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:25,115
Let's go.

5
00:01:25,251 --> 00:01:26,411
Hold on.

6
00:01:29,055 --> 00:01:30,920
I can't now.

7
00:01:31,057 --> 00:01:32,922
I can't get up now.

8
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:34,720
Why not?

9
00:01:36,663 --> 00:01:38,028
He's up.

10
00:01:42,268 --> 00:01:45,635
He'll go down soon.

11
00:01:46,573 --> 00:01:48,438
When?

12
00:01:48,575 --> 00:01:49,735
Soon.

13
00:01:51,678 --> 00:01:53,236
He goes down that soon?

14
00:01:53,379 --> 00:01:55,643
Yes, give it a minute.

15
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:18,833
Do you do drugs?

16
00:02:29,682 --> 00:02:31,206
It's time to go.

17
00:02:35,755 --> 00:02:36,915
Shall we?

18
00:02:49,969 --> 00:02:51,834
Hi, Teacher!

19
00:03:07,554 --> 00:03:20,126
<i>To do or not to do</i>

20
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:24,132
Let me introduce students...

21
00:03:25,171 --> 00:03:27,833
No, soon-to-be teachers.

22
00:03:34,981 --> 00:03:38,712
We're very excited
to be here.

23
00:03:38,851 --> 00:03:42,719
And to be learning
from you all.

24
00:03:56,569 --> 00:04:00,027
Where's LEE Yu-lim's desk?

25
00:04:04,877 --> 00:04:07,471
That asshole...

26
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:08,740
What?

27
00:04:09,449 --> 00:04:13,044
I told him to wait
to meet the student teachers.

28
00:04:13,152 --> 00:04:15,313
He said he was too tired
and left.

29
00:04:15,455 --> 00:04:22,918
I bet he's sleeping
in his car.

30
00:04:25,365 --> 00:04:28,926
He drank a lot last night.

31
00:04:29,068 --> 00:04:30,228
Get the picture?

32
00:04:39,178 --> 00:04:40,338
How old are you?

33
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:47,417
- Born in 78?
- Yes.

34
00:04:47,553 --> 00:04:50,021
You went back to school?

35
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:55,223
I went to another college.

36
00:04:56,262 --> 00:04:57,627
What was your major?

37
00:04:58,464 --> 00:04:59,624
Art.

38
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:02,031
Art...

39
00:05:06,773 --> 00:05:09,640
- Why do you wanna do this?
- Sorry?

40
00:05:10,376 --> 00:05:11,536
I mean teach.

41
00:05:14,681 --> 00:05:18,617
Well, it's a stable career.

42
00:05:18,751 --> 00:05:22,016
But it's no fun.

43
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:24,214
Teaching is no fun.

44
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:27,817
Okay.

45
00:05:30,963 --> 00:05:34,831
Watch out for the VP.
He's very anal.

46
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:37,636
It won't be easy at first.

47
00:05:39,372 --> 00:05:42,637
It's a lot of politics.

48
00:05:42,775 --> 00:05:46,939
Flattery isn't all it takes.

49
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:51,915
They smile to your face,
but talk dirty behind your back.

50
00:05:52,051 --> 00:05:55,418
You should know
when to push and tell.

51
00:05:57,957 --> 00:05:59,117
Okay.

52
00:06:05,465 --> 00:06:09,333
No questions?

53
00:06:09,469 --> 00:06:13,337
Today is the first day,
and I'm kind of lost.

54
00:06:18,678 --> 00:06:22,045
How old are you, LEE?

55
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:25,310
Umm...

56
00:06:26,953 --> 00:06:28,614
I'm 26.

57
00:06:31,257 --> 00:06:33,122
So I'm a year younger.

58
00:06:47,173 --> 00:06:49,641
Isn't she the student teacher
for your class?

59
00:06:49,842 --> 00:06:52,902
Wow, she looks so different.

60
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:55,547
Quite pretty and elegant.

61
00:06:59,552 --> 00:07:00,814
Where to?

62
00:07:00,953 --> 00:07:02,215
Hi.

63
00:07:02,355 --> 00:07:03,515
Hop in.

64
00:07:03,656 --> 00:07:05,123
No, it's okay.

65
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:07,818
It's hard to get a cab here.

66
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:12,622
Get in.
Come drinking with us.

67
00:07:12,899 --> 00:07:14,992
Drinking?
Is it on you?

68
00:07:15,168 --> 00:07:16,135
Sure.

69
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:17,429
Come on, he's paying.

70
00:07:21,974 --> 00:07:23,441
I have to go.

71
00:07:33,052 --> 00:07:35,418
A boyfriend driving a Mercedes?

72
00:07:35,555 --> 00:07:36,522
He must be loaded.

73
00:07:36,656 --> 00:07:40,023
What does she think she is,
driving such a car?

74
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:42,527
It's her boyfriend's.

75
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:45,624
So you're buying drinks?

76
00:07:46,165 --> 00:07:47,325
I lied.

77
00:07:48,067 --> 00:07:50,934
- No way.
- Give me a cigarette.

78
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:53,231
It's new on the market.

79
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:57,943
It looks great on you.

80
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:00,843
It makes you stand out.

81
00:08:03,082 --> 00:08:04,310
Do you like it?

82
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:07,979
I don't like it.

83
00:08:09,856 --> 00:08:12,825
I told you
this wasn't my thing.

84
00:08:15,761 --> 00:08:18,025
Why don't you try...
Forget it.

85
00:08:27,273 --> 00:08:29,138
- Good night
- I have surgery tonight.

86
00:08:30,076 --> 00:08:31,338
I won't be reachable
by phone.

87
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:33,338
Call me.

88
00:10:05,972 --> 00:10:07,940
- Yu-lim.
- What?

89
00:10:08,074 --> 00:10:09,632
You're different tonight.

90
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:15,039
What?

91
00:10:16,549 --> 00:10:17,709
I'm loving it.

92
00:10:18,351 --> 00:10:20,012
Yeah, me too.

93
00:10:27,259 --> 00:10:31,628
<i>We provide ideal circumstances</i>
<i>for studying</i>

94
00:10:31,764 --> 00:10:36,030
<i>with the best facilities</i>
<i>in the country. </i>

95
00:10:36,168 --> 00:10:41,538
<i>We rear those who will lead... </i>

96
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:46,243
We always go to SokCho
for school fieldtrips.

97
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:47,937
Why not Jeju Island?

98
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:54,415
It was your boyfriend,
wasn't it?

99
00:10:56,555 --> 00:10:58,523
Yes.

100
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:02,424
He must be rich.

101
00:11:05,364 --> 00:11:06,524
Yes.

102
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:15,436
We're going out tonight.

103
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:17,437
Pay your dues.

104
00:11:17,576 --> 00:11:19,737
- How much?
- $30

105
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:24,216
And $10 for her.
So it's $40 for both of you.

106
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:26,409
I have no cash on me.

107
00:11:26,552 --> 00:11:28,713
You pay for me.
I'll pay you back later.

108
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:33,018
- I'm broke too.
- Come on, don't be cheap.

109
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:35,923
You always do this.

110
00:11:38,264 --> 00:11:39,424
You're really broke?

111
00:11:40,066 --> 00:11:42,125
- I'll pay you back!
- Here.

112
00:11:46,672 --> 00:11:49,436
You don't carry a wallet
on purpose, or what?

113
00:11:54,313 --> 00:11:56,907
I was gonna
go to the bank later.

114
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:10,019
Why don't you sing?

115
00:12:10,863 --> 00:12:13,229
- You go ahead.
- Come on.

116
00:12:13,365 --> 00:12:14,627
Please.

117
00:12:14,867 --> 00:12:15,834
I go first?

118
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:18,229
Okay.

119
00:12:45,664 --> 00:12:48,633
Hey, why'd you stop?

120
00:12:50,069 --> 00:12:52,833
This is no fun.
Let's go somewhere else.

121
00:12:55,074 --> 00:12:57,542
I have to go.

122
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:02,236
I think of us as partners.

123
00:13:03,649 --> 00:13:06,015
I don't care about others.

124
00:13:06,152 --> 00:13:07,915
But between you and me,

125
00:13:08,187 --> 00:13:11,213
there should be a partnership.

126
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:13,823
What do you think?

127
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:15,824
I agree.

128
00:13:15,961 --> 00:13:20,728
- You sure?
- Yes.

129
00:13:20,866 --> 00:13:25,530
You're not just saying that,
are you?

130
00:13:25,671 --> 00:13:26,831
No.

131
00:13:27,373 --> 00:13:32,743
Tonight, we should be doing
a lot of talking.

132
00:13:32,878 --> 00:13:36,814
I wanted to talk a lot too.

133
00:13:36,949 --> 00:13:39,417
But something came up
at home.

134
00:13:39,552 --> 00:13:44,512
If that's the case...

135
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:47,421
- I'm really sorry.
- It's okay.

136
00:13:48,761 --> 00:13:49,921
Bye.

137
00:13:53,065 --> 00:13:54,225
Wait.

138
00:13:57,269 --> 00:13:59,737
Will it take long?

139
00:13:59,872 --> 00:14:03,239
I don't know.
I should go and see.

140
00:14:05,277 --> 00:14:06,642
Here's what.

141
00:14:08,781 --> 00:14:12,717
Can you make it back
when you're done?

142
00:14:14,119 --> 00:14:15,984
I'll call you.

143
00:14:16,121 --> 00:14:18,282
We won't be done before 12.
Give me a call.

144
00:14:18,424 --> 00:14:20,483
Okay.

145
00:14:22,828 --> 00:14:23,886
Not offended, right?

146
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:25,587
Right.

147
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:38,601
You can come now.

148
00:14:38,944 --> 00:14:43,581
Nobody's going home
until you get here.

149
00:14:43,616 --> 00:14:47,780
- Don't overdo it.
- We'll be waiting, CHOI.

150
00:14:50,222 --> 00:14:51,689
Hello?

151
00:14:52,524 --> 00:14:53,786
Okay, hold on.

152
00:14:58,964 --> 00:15:04,493
He says the surgery won't be over
until morning.

153
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:07,999
Thanks.

154
00:15:22,521 --> 00:15:24,682
They all left?

155
00:15:24,823 --> 00:15:25,289
Yeah.

156
00:15:26,625 --> 00:15:28,388
They were too wasted.

157
00:15:32,031 --> 00:15:34,591
I called you so many times.

158
00:15:35,534 --> 00:15:37,297
You didn't answer.

159
00:15:38,237 --> 00:15:40,000
It was out of battery.

160
00:15:49,548 --> 00:15:52,676
Okay then.

161
00:15:52,818 --> 00:15:57,687
Why don't we drink
and talk?

162
00:16:02,928 --> 00:16:06,796
Don't you have any other
love stories to share?

163
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:09,896
A heart-breaking one.

164
00:16:12,538 --> 00:16:13,698
No.

165
00:16:21,947 --> 00:16:23,778
You must like clams.

166
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:28,682
Yes.

167
00:16:30,022 --> 00:16:31,785
You guys have sex,
don't you?

168
00:16:34,927 --> 00:16:38,090
Every couple does, don't they?

169
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:39,390
What about you?

170
00:16:41,433 --> 00:16:44,800
It's been about 2 months.

171
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:50,207
After 6 years of dating,
you kind of lose interest.

172
00:16:50,342 --> 00:16:51,502
6 years?

173
00:16:53,245 --> 00:16:55,008
Do you love her?

174
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:56,507
Sure.

175
00:16:58,317 --> 00:17:00,785
She's more like a sister now.

176
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,083
I see.

177
00:17:03,922 --> 00:17:05,822
What does she do?

178
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:10,188
The same thing I do.

179
00:17:11,330 --> 00:17:12,490
Which school?

180
00:17:13,832 --> 00:17:14,992
At MyungShin High.

181
00:17:15,834 --> 00:17:16,994
MyungShin High?

182
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:20,699
A friend of mine works there.

183
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:22,397
What's her name?

184
00:17:23,642 --> 00:17:26,702
I'll tell you later.

185
00:17:26,845 --> 00:17:29,279
It's okay.

186
00:17:33,018 --> 00:17:34,178
Excuse me.

187
00:17:58,077 --> 00:17:59,544
You have beautiful legs.

188
00:18:00,679 --> 00:18:01,839
Thanks.

189
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:05,512
You're eating a lot of clams.

190
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:08,913
Have some.

191
00:18:12,257 --> 00:18:15,317
I feel like
a different kind of clam.

192
00:18:28,373 --> 00:18:30,341
- CHOI.
- Yes?

193
00:18:30,476 --> 00:18:32,535
I don't know if I should be
saying this, but...

194
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:36,447
I wanna sleep with you.

195
00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:40,611
Let's do it.

196
00:18:40,752 --> 00:18:42,117
Stop it, LEE.

197
00:18:42,254 --> 00:18:44,313
I wanna hold you.

198
00:18:44,456 --> 00:18:46,720
I think you're drunk.
Let's go.

199
00:18:46,859 --> 00:18:50,727
I'm very straightforward.

200
00:18:50,863 --> 00:18:53,229
Isn't it better
than being a pervert?

201
00:18:55,868 --> 00:18:59,531
You do this to every girl
you meet?

202
00:19:01,773 --> 00:19:02,933
No way.

203
00:19:04,776 --> 00:19:06,437
Only when I like her.

204
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:09,340
You like me?

205
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:11,309
Yes.

206
00:19:12,351 --> 00:19:13,909
But we just met.

207
00:19:14,052 --> 00:19:17,613
At first sight,
I knew I liked you.

208
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:25,828
Have you had sex
with a total stranger?

209
00:19:26,765 --> 00:19:27,823
Sure.

210
00:19:27,966 --> 00:19:29,331
There are girls like that?

211
00:19:29,468 --> 00:19:31,629
Of course.
They're so many.

212
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:33,431
How's that possible?

213
00:19:33,572 --> 00:19:34,732
What?

214
00:19:34,873 --> 00:19:36,932
Having sex without love?

215
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:42,841
Why are you laughing?

216
00:19:42,981 --> 00:19:45,415
You're like a kid.

217
00:19:45,551 --> 00:19:48,213
Come on, you're not 16.

218
00:19:50,455 --> 00:19:53,913
Love is good
for the first 3 months.

219
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:57,320
Exhilarating?
Electric?

220
00:20:01,166 --> 00:20:03,726
According to this research,

221
00:20:04,369 --> 00:20:08,430
there's this hormone
that gives such feelings

222
00:20:08,574 --> 00:20:10,439
And it lasts for 3 months.

223
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:15,540
Isn't it 3 years?
I heard it was 3 years.

224
00:20:17,449 --> 00:20:18,814
It's 3 months.

225
00:20:22,454 --> 00:20:26,515
So if you feel like it,
just do it.

226
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:31,723
Love is a funny thing.

227
00:20:31,964 --> 00:20:33,124
It doesn't exit.

228
00:20:33,665 --> 00:20:40,434
If you see someone you like,
sleep with him.

229
00:20:40,572 --> 00:20:42,540
No strings.
Be cool about it.

230
00:20:50,649 --> 00:20:52,014
Sorry.

231
00:20:52,684 --> 00:20:54,879
I don't feel like it.

232
00:21:03,662 --> 00:21:04,822
Wait.

233
00:21:07,165 --> 00:21:09,133
Why don't we kiss over there?

234
00:21:18,076 --> 00:21:19,134
Hold on.

235
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:23,044
LEE, you're putting us
in an awkward situation.

236
00:21:23,849 --> 00:21:26,113
What did I do?

237
00:21:26,251 --> 00:21:29,414
All I wanted was sex.

238
00:21:29,554 --> 00:21:33,718
It might make things
easier for us.

239
00:21:39,164 --> 00:21:42,327
So many motels around here.

240
00:21:49,675 --> 00:21:51,939
You live in Hapjung, right?

241
00:21:52,077 --> 00:21:53,237
Yes.

242
00:21:58,350 --> 00:22:00,113
- Hapjung!
- Sorry.

243
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:09,725
Wait!

244
00:22:10,462 --> 00:22:11,724
Hapjung!

245
00:22:13,765 --> 00:22:15,027
Hapjung!

246
00:22:17,736 --> 00:22:19,363
Hapjung!

247
00:22:22,774 --> 00:22:24,742
Did you see that new teacher?

248
00:22:24,876 --> 00:22:27,037
Yeah, she's a fox!

249
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:29,044
She worked at Il-sin High before.

250
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:31,012
She had an affair
with a married teacher.

251
00:22:31,149 --> 00:22:32,810
Word got out
and she got fired.

252
00:22:32,951 --> 00:22:34,714
- What a slut!
- Tell me about it.

253
00:22:34,853 --> 00:22:38,914
Should I hit on her?
She might fall for me.

254
00:22:39,057 --> 00:22:40,718
Dream on!

255
00:22:41,259 --> 00:22:42,419
Let's go sit.

256
00:22:42,561 --> 00:22:43,721
Hi.

257
00:22:44,663 --> 00:22:46,324
So you guys watch it.

258
00:22:46,865 --> 00:22:49,129
This field is very conservative.

259
00:22:49,267 --> 00:22:52,430
Once you mess up
like that,

260
00:22:53,271 --> 00:22:55,034
you're branded for life.

261
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:07,411
Got home okay last night?

262
00:23:08,153 --> 00:23:09,313
Yes.

263
00:23:09,554 --> 00:23:10,714
Over here, CHOI.

264
00:23:11,356 --> 00:23:12,414
Hi.

265
00:23:12,557 --> 00:23:14,320
I'll eat here.

266
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:16,320
Eat with me.

267
00:23:16,762 --> 00:23:18,320
I'll eat with them.

268
00:23:19,664 --> 00:23:21,325
I don't wanna eat alone.

269
00:23:21,566 --> 00:23:23,830
Come on.

270
00:23:25,971 --> 00:23:27,438
Slept well?

271
00:23:27,973 --> 00:23:28,837
No.

272
00:23:28,974 --> 00:23:29,736
Why not?

273
00:23:29,875 --> 00:23:31,433
I have insomnia.

274
00:23:31,576 --> 00:23:32,736
Really?

275
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:35,808
How many hours of sleep a day?

276
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:40,511
I rarely sleep.

277
00:23:46,958 --> 00:23:49,426
Excuse me.

278
00:23:50,362 --> 00:23:52,227
You hardly touched anything.

279
00:23:52,364 --> 00:23:54,229
I've lost my appetite.

280
00:23:54,366 --> 00:23:55,833
Enjoy your lunch.

281
00:23:56,868 --> 00:23:58,028
Wait.

282
00:23:59,571 --> 00:24:01,471
I don't feel like eating either.

283
00:24:02,174 --> 00:24:04,335
Let's go have some coffee.

284
00:24:04,476 --> 00:24:05,636
Let's go.

285
00:24:41,079 --> 00:24:44,310
Try to get some sleep.

286
00:24:55,227 --> 00:24:59,493
Go to bed.
Why can't you sleep?

287
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:05,432
Let me help you.
Sleep some.

288
00:25:42,874 --> 00:25:44,034
<i>Insomnia?</i>

289
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:51,611
We're not here to party,
but to learn.

290
00:25:51,917 --> 00:25:56,684
Before checking in for the night,

291
00:25:56,855 --> 00:25:59,619
we'll run a check
on your belongings.

292
00:25:59,758 --> 00:26:01,919
Teachers, do it thoroughly.

293
00:26:14,372 --> 00:26:16,636
They brought everything.

294
00:26:18,176 --> 00:26:21,145
That Hennessy is mine.

295
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:24,713
No way.
We'll share it.

296
00:26:26,952 --> 00:26:28,920
Founders keepers!

297
00:26:30,355 --> 00:26:33,324
Whom should we drink with?

298
00:26:33,458 --> 00:26:35,926
Count the PE teacher out.

299
00:26:42,067 --> 00:26:44,627
<i>Let me hear it!</i>

300
00:26:44,769 --> 00:26:47,533
<i>It doesn't matter who wins. </i>

301
00:26:47,672 --> 00:26:50,539
<i>Under the feet!</i>

302
00:26:50,675 --> 00:26:52,142
<i>Under the feet!</i>

303
00:26:52,277 --> 00:26:54,643
<i>Make it louder, guys!</i>

304
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:56,806
<i>Louder!</i>

305
00:27:03,021 --> 00:27:04,181
Hey.

306
00:27:06,358 --> 00:27:07,518
Get over here.

307
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:09,920
KIM!

308
00:27:10,662 --> 00:27:14,428
You can sing
your throat out later.

309
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:26,444
Why isn't she answering?

310
00:27:26,578 --> 00:27:27,738
It's an alarm.

311
00:27:29,547 --> 00:27:31,447
I thought you had insomnia.

312
00:27:33,785 --> 00:27:37,516
Somebody else set it,
but I don't know how to undo it.

313
00:27:39,457 --> 00:27:42,017
Let me do it for you.

314
00:27:47,132 --> 00:27:48,963
It's weird.

315
00:27:50,168 --> 00:27:51,226
What's wrong with it?

316
00:27:51,369 --> 00:27:53,030
<i>Phonebook</i>
<i>Deleting</i>

317
00:27:54,439 --> 00:27:55,997
This isn't right.

318
00:27:56,107 --> 00:27:57,267
What?

319
00:28:02,681 --> 00:28:04,012
<i>All numbers deleted</i>

320
00:28:05,116 --> 00:28:07,175
Where'd you buy it?

321
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:09,783
You need to have it fixed.

322
00:28:22,167 --> 00:28:23,725
Wait.

323
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:27,337
We need to talk.

324
00:28:27,472 --> 00:28:28,530
About what?

325
00:28:28,673 --> 00:28:33,440
You misunderstand.
I didn't do it on purpose.

326
00:28:36,848 --> 00:28:38,611
I'm sorry.

327
00:28:40,151 --> 00:28:42,619
Give me a break, will you?

328
00:28:44,255 --> 00:28:46,120
I'll fix it.

329
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:50,220
Forget it.

330
00:29:03,174 --> 00:29:04,334
Don't be mad.

331
00:29:07,178 --> 00:29:09,646
I can't bear the guilt.

332
00:29:13,184 --> 00:29:14,549
Okay.

333
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:24,524
Smile for me.

334
00:29:26,664 --> 00:29:27,926
Go ahead.

335
00:29:30,869 --> 00:29:32,029
Come on.

336
00:29:35,073 --> 00:29:36,233
There you go.

337
00:31:08,466 --> 00:31:11,924
Come on, come on.

338
00:31:13,972 --> 00:31:15,530
Please, stop it.

339
00:31:15,673 --> 00:31:16,833
Why?

340
00:31:24,148 --> 00:31:25,615
This is wrong.

341
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:27,210
Come on.

342
00:31:28,553 --> 00:31:30,612
I'll keep him in
for 5 seconds.

343
00:31:32,257 --> 00:31:33,724
Are you nuts?

344
00:31:33,858 --> 00:31:35,519
5 seconds!

345
00:31:37,161 --> 00:31:38,423
Stop it!

346
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:56,440
You okay?

347
00:32:00,451 --> 00:32:02,612
- Get off me.
- Wait, CHOI.

348
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:03,914
CHOI?

349
00:32:07,825 --> 00:32:08,985
CHOI!

350
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:53,732
<i>Can I see you later?</i>

351
00:32:53,871 --> 00:32:55,634
<i>We need to talk. </i>

352
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:01,138
Who is it?

353
00:33:01,779 --> 00:33:02,837
It's Hye-won.

354
00:33:02,981 --> 00:33:06,815
My counselor's girlfriend
works at her school.

355
00:33:06,951 --> 00:33:08,111
Really?

356
00:33:08,252 --> 00:33:12,211
They've been together
for 6 years.

357
00:33:12,457 --> 00:33:13,924
They're getting married soon.

358
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:18,527
Is he nice to you?

359
00:33:19,364 --> 00:33:22,629
No, not at all.

360
00:33:22,767 --> 00:33:26,328
He's mean
and a pain in the neck.

361
00:33:26,471 --> 00:33:28,735
No chemistry at all.

362
00:33:29,474 --> 00:33:30,839
Should we order more?

363
00:33:31,676 --> 00:33:32,836
I'm full, though.

364
00:33:39,083 --> 00:33:41,278
She's ignoring my messages.

365
00:33:51,262 --> 00:33:53,628
<i>- Hi. </i>
<i>- Come on in. </i>

366
00:33:53,765 --> 00:33:54,925
<i>Here you go. </i>

367
00:33:56,067 --> 00:33:58,331
<i>You didn't have to do this. </i>

368
00:33:59,470 --> 00:34:00,437
<i>Oh, it's caviar. </i>

369
00:34:00,571 --> 00:34:04,029
<i>- I know you like it. </i>
<i>- You're so sweet. </i>

370
00:34:05,777 --> 00:34:07,335
What'd he get you?

371
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:12,607
He never buys me anything
from school fieldtrips.

372
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:18,017
I gave him whatever he wanted,
raising him without his dad.

373
00:34:18,156 --> 00:34:20,522
So he doesn't know
how to give back.

374
00:34:20,958 --> 00:34:23,620
Don't raise your kids
like that.

375
00:34:29,467 --> 00:34:34,234
Why do you come over
so often?

376
00:34:35,473 --> 00:34:40,137
You would ask me to come
and help your mom.

377
00:34:42,180 --> 00:34:44,307
Forget it.

378
00:35:02,467 --> 00:35:04,025
Good morning!
Did you...

379
00:35:09,474 --> 00:35:10,736
This is good.

380
00:35:11,175 --> 00:35:13,040
I've never thought of this.

381
00:35:13,377 --> 00:35:15,641
I'm learning a lot
from you too.

382
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:17,111
Very nice.

383
00:35:30,862 --> 00:35:32,022
Here.

384
00:35:34,565 --> 00:35:36,931
Can I go now?

385
00:35:40,471 --> 00:35:42,735
Meet me out back
in an hour.

386
00:35:45,877 --> 00:35:47,037
Excuse me.

387
00:36:04,562 --> 00:36:06,621
How about bean curd soup?

388
00:36:06,764 --> 00:36:08,925
I know this place.

389
00:36:09,066 --> 00:36:10,829
It's really good.

390
00:36:10,968 --> 00:36:12,526
You know I hate it.

391
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:15,036
Come on, you'll like it.

392
00:36:15,173 --> 00:36:16,538
That place was even on TV.

393
00:36:16,674 --> 00:36:18,938
It's homemade style!

394
00:36:19,076 --> 00:36:22,239
Let's eat something else.

395
00:36:23,514 --> 00:36:25,675
CHOI, what do you feel like?

396
00:36:26,417 --> 00:36:28,681
You can decide for us.

397
00:36:28,953 --> 00:36:30,818
Bean curd soup sounds good.

398
00:36:33,157 --> 00:36:36,820
I can't believe
how delicious this is.

399
00:36:41,666 --> 00:36:44,226
Not good?

400
00:36:44,769 --> 00:36:46,066
It's good.

401
00:36:46,270 --> 00:36:47,532
You don't like it?

402
00:36:48,172 --> 00:36:49,434
Should I?

403
00:36:49,674 --> 00:36:50,834
Thanks.

404
00:37:02,153 --> 00:37:04,713
It's a great day
for a car wash.

405
00:37:04,855 --> 00:37:07,619
What's the point?
It's a jalopy.

406
00:37:11,562 --> 00:37:13,029
- Coffee.
- Thanks.

407
00:37:14,365 --> 00:37:16,731
- Go ahead.
- No, I'm okay.

408
00:37:37,755 --> 00:37:38,915
Excuse me?

409
00:37:40,958 --> 00:37:42,118
LEE?

410
00:37:44,061 --> 00:37:45,221
What?

411
00:37:46,664 --> 00:37:49,531
Can I see the final papers
from last semester?

412
00:38:18,262 --> 00:38:20,822
Can we talk for a minute?

413
00:38:26,570 --> 00:38:28,936
Anything bothering you?

414
00:38:30,975 --> 00:38:32,135
No.

415
00:38:33,477 --> 00:38:36,037
You hardly ate earlier.

416
00:38:36,547 --> 00:38:38,014
Aren't you hungry?

417
00:38:43,954 --> 00:38:45,114
I am.

418
00:38:47,058 --> 00:38:49,219
Wanna go to the cafeteria
with me?

419
00:38:50,661 --> 00:38:53,323
No. Better yet...

420
00:38:57,868 --> 00:39:00,132
You got aspirin?

421
00:39:00,271 --> 00:39:02,432
I have a terrible headache.

422
00:39:04,575 --> 00:39:06,736
Let me go get some.

423
00:39:07,178 --> 00:39:08,338
Wait.

424
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:10,906
Oh God...

425
00:39:13,551 --> 00:39:14,916
What's wrong with me?

426
00:39:18,155 --> 00:39:19,713
Come here, will you?

427
00:39:24,261 --> 00:39:25,728
Come on, closer.

428
00:39:30,067 --> 00:39:32,729
My head hurts so much.

429
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:34,838
Can I lean on you?

430
00:39:39,777 --> 00:39:40,937
Much better.

431
00:39:42,279 --> 00:39:43,405
So nice.

432
00:39:51,555 --> 00:39:53,716
Your girlfriend
at MyungShin High...

433
00:39:53,858 --> 00:39:55,519
It's KIM Hui-jung, isn't it?

434
00:40:00,464 --> 00:40:01,829
How'd you know?

435
00:40:03,567 --> 00:40:07,526
I told you my friend works there.

436
00:40:18,749 --> 00:40:20,717
- Did you Tell her?
- What?

437
00:40:23,053 --> 00:40:25,715
- That I'm hitting on you.
- Yes.

438
00:40:26,657 --> 00:40:27,817
What?

439
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:30,320
I shouldn't have?

440
00:40:40,571 --> 00:40:41,833
You really did?

441
00:40:43,073 --> 00:40:44,438
Yes.

442
00:40:44,575 --> 00:40:45,735
What'd you tell her?

443
00:40:47,478 --> 00:40:49,810
- About you.
- What about me?

444
00:40:49,947 --> 00:40:51,005
Everything.

445
00:40:51,649 --> 00:40:54,311
What, you feel guilty?

446
00:40:59,256 --> 00:41:00,814
Look, CHOI.

447
00:41:01,559 --> 00:41:04,824
It's a private matter
between us.

448
00:41:04,962 --> 00:41:07,123
How could you?

449
00:41:07,264 --> 00:41:09,232
Unless you're crazy...

450
00:41:11,068 --> 00:41:14,834
How could a reasonable being
do such a thing?

451
00:41:14,972 --> 00:41:17,031
Are you insane?

452
00:41:21,879 --> 00:41:23,403
Let's talk outside.

453
00:41:28,252 --> 00:41:32,416
Teachers in general are
very stern and conservative.

454
00:41:32,556 --> 00:41:37,016
Since you're new and green,

455
00:41:37,161 --> 00:41:39,425
I just wanted to help you
adapt better.

456
00:41:40,264 --> 00:41:44,428
I haven't pulled hierarchy shit
on you, have I?

457
00:41:47,671 --> 00:41:49,138
You think this is funny?

458
00:41:50,674 --> 00:41:53,142
Who do you think you are?

459
00:41:53,277 --> 00:41:56,144
You can't survive here
with that attitude.

460
00:41:57,147 --> 00:41:59,206
Never seen a student teacher
like you.

461
00:42:01,151 --> 00:42:05,212
I've been so nice to you,
and you disdain me?

462
00:42:06,357 --> 00:42:09,724
Then stop bothering me.

463
00:42:10,461 --> 00:42:13,521
CHOI,

464
00:42:14,265 --> 00:42:16,324
I think you are totally mistaken.

465
00:42:16,467 --> 00:42:18,435
- I wasn't...
- I'm warning you.

466
00:42:19,069 --> 00:42:20,832
Don't you touch me again.

467
00:42:23,874 --> 00:42:25,034
CHOI...

468
00:42:26,677 --> 00:42:28,941
You hate me that much?

469
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:31,705
I really liked you.

470
00:42:33,250 --> 00:42:35,013
Wanna sleep with me?

471
00:42:38,756 --> 00:42:39,916
Yes.

472
00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:43,724
What?

473
00:42:43,861 --> 00:42:45,328
It's $500.

474
00:42:45,763 --> 00:42:47,128
What is?

475
00:42:47,264 --> 00:42:49,926
It will cost you $500
to sleep with me.

476
00:42:53,470 --> 00:42:54,630
Are you nuts?

477
00:42:58,175 --> 00:43:01,042
I never do it for nothing.

478
00:43:01,178 --> 00:43:02,941
What are you, a hooker?

479
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:04,809
Isn't it better?

480
00:43:04,949 --> 00:43:07,816
There's no love between us.
So why do it?

481
00:43:10,854 --> 00:43:13,823
What's wrong with you?
Come to your senses!

482
00:43:20,664 --> 00:43:22,325
Then forget it.

483
00:43:29,573 --> 00:43:31,234
There's motel out there.

484
00:43:38,849 --> 00:43:41,716
Let's go somewhere quiet
and talk.

485
00:43:41,852 --> 00:43:43,012
Talk.

486
00:43:44,054 --> 00:43:45,817
Not here.

487
00:43:45,956 --> 00:43:49,722
I didn't hit on you
just for sex.

488
00:43:49,860 --> 00:43:51,623
I don't want to any more.

489
00:43:52,162 --> 00:43:54,824
I'm doing this
only because I like you.

490
00:43:55,466 --> 00:43:57,627
Why can't you see that?

491
00:43:58,869 --> 00:44:03,238
<i>Motel</i>

492
00:44:04,475 --> 00:44:06,739
If you have nothing to say,
let's go.

493
00:44:07,978 --> 00:44:10,003
Come up here please.

494
00:44:10,748 --> 00:44:12,113
No thanks.

495
00:44:13,250 --> 00:44:15,912
I'm so tired.
Why don't we...

496
00:44:16,253 --> 00:44:17,413
Wait.

497
00:44:18,756 --> 00:44:20,417
Come here for a second.

498
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:25,121
Just for a second.

499
00:44:26,764 --> 00:44:27,924
Come here.

500
00:44:41,779 --> 00:44:43,212
You taste so good.

501
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:47,510
What are you doing?

502
00:44:48,852 --> 00:44:50,217
You want $500?

503
00:44:51,155 --> 00:44:52,520
I'll give you $500.

504
00:44:53,357 --> 00:44:54,722
You're so wet.

505
00:45:02,266 --> 00:45:04,427
If you wanna do it, do it right.

506
00:45:21,452 --> 00:45:26,287
You wanted to do me
at first sight, didn't you?

507
00:46:37,861 --> 00:46:39,021
You're so good.

508
00:46:39,963 --> 00:46:41,123
You too.

509
00:46:42,966 --> 00:46:45,935
I can't believe your boyfriend
doesn't do you every night.

510
00:46:46,069 --> 00:46:47,627
What a waste?

511
00:46:48,872 --> 00:46:50,339
I don't like sex.

512
00:46:52,876 --> 00:46:54,036
You do.

513
00:46:55,879 --> 00:46:57,005
I don't.

514
00:46:58,749 --> 00:47:00,216
Yes, you do.

515
00:47:23,207 --> 00:47:25,368
<i>Missed calls? Hui-jung</i>

516
00:47:34,151 --> 00:47:35,812
Hey, what's up?

517
00:47:35,953 --> 00:47:38,513
<i>Where were you?</i>
<i>You didn't answer your phone. </i>

518
00:47:40,457 --> 00:47:44,518
Oh... we had a meeting.

519
00:47:44,661 --> 00:47:46,322
A long one.

520
00:47:46,563 --> 00:47:48,929
<i>Yeah, really?</i>

521
00:47:49,066 --> 00:47:50,033
Yeah

522
00:47:50,167 --> 00:47:52,635
<i>- Getting off early?</i>
- Yeah.

523
00:47:53,470 --> 00:47:55,836
<i>Let's go eat steamed Angler</i>
<i>for dinner. </i>

524
00:47:55,973 --> 00:47:58,840
<i>You like it, don't you?</i>

525
00:48:00,177 --> 00:48:03,806
Yeah, I do.

526
00:48:03,947 --> 00:48:08,816
But I don't feel good today.

527
00:48:09,853 --> 00:48:12,014
<i>- You don't?</i>
- No.

528
00:48:12,856 --> 00:48:14,016
Listen.

529
00:48:14,558 --> 00:48:17,322
I'm kind of busy now.
I'll call you back.

530
00:48:18,562 --> 00:48:19,722
Okay.

531
00:48:20,464 --> 00:48:22,227
Did you talk to her?

532
00:48:22,366 --> 00:48:23,526
What?

533
00:48:24,167 --> 00:48:25,327
Wasn't it Hui-jung?

534
00:48:26,370 --> 00:48:27,632
Yes.

535
00:48:27,771 --> 00:48:28,931
How'd you know?

536
00:48:29,072 --> 00:48:32,132
She called many times earlier.

537
00:48:34,578 --> 00:48:36,045
So...?

538
00:48:36,179 --> 00:48:39,205
You left with that student teacher.

539
00:48:39,349 --> 00:48:41,817
So I told her
you guys went for lunch.

540
00:48:42,753 --> 00:48:44,812
God damn it!

541
00:48:45,856 --> 00:48:47,016
What?

542
00:48:48,358 --> 00:48:50,918
Why the fuck did you
tell her that?

543
00:48:52,663 --> 00:48:55,131
Watch your mouth, kid.

544
00:48:55,265 --> 00:48:58,029
Jesus fucking Christ!

545
00:49:00,470 --> 00:49:01,630
What the...

546
00:49:03,974 --> 00:49:07,239
This is really good.
Eat some.

547
00:49:07,377 --> 00:49:09,538
Yeah, I am.

548
00:49:12,049 --> 00:49:13,607
You feel better now?

549
00:49:16,153 --> 00:49:19,122
Yeah, this helps.

550
00:49:19,256 --> 00:49:23,215
You know spicy food is
good for colds.

551
00:49:27,264 --> 00:49:29,425
Where were you?
It's late.

552
00:49:37,674 --> 00:49:39,437
Why didn't you call me?

553
00:49:39,576 --> 00:49:41,441
I did.
You didn't answer it.

554
00:49:42,879 --> 00:49:44,403
I didn't know.

555
00:49:47,451 --> 00:49:53,720
Your cousin's fiancé
studied economics abroad.

556
00:49:53,857 --> 00:49:55,119
Here.

557
00:49:56,259 --> 00:49:58,227
They bragged so much.

558
00:49:59,062 --> 00:50:03,226
So your dad told them
you were dating a doctor.

559
00:50:05,469 --> 00:50:08,336
It's the whole competition thing.

560
00:50:08,672 --> 00:50:09,798
Why? Oh dad...

561
00:50:09,973 --> 00:50:12,942
It's not like
we're getting married.

562
00:50:13,076 --> 00:50:16,512
You've met his parents.
It's a done deal.

563
00:50:17,047 --> 00:50:18,605
How's he doing?

564
00:50:20,550 --> 00:50:24,008
Not good.
The economy is so down.

565
00:50:29,559 --> 00:50:31,220
<i>KIM Yeon-ho</i>

566
00:50:32,662 --> 00:50:35,028
<i>Leave a message after... </i>

567
00:50:41,872 --> 00:50:44,033
<i>Here's an important notice. </i>

568
00:50:44,174 --> 00:50:48,042
<i>Our school has a problem</i>

569
00:50:48,178 --> 00:50:49,645
<i>Since last spring... </i>

570
00:50:51,348 --> 00:50:53,509
I called you a few times
last night.

571
00:50:54,251 --> 00:50:57,220
It was out of battery.

572
00:50:57,354 --> 00:50:59,015
Are you free tonight?

573
00:50:59,756 --> 00:51:01,417
No, I'm busy.

574
00:51:02,059 --> 00:51:09,522
I know this new raw fish restaurant.
Delicious and cheap.

575
00:51:13,870 --> 00:51:15,861
Can I see you
after the meeting?

576
00:51:18,108 --> 00:51:18,938
Why?

577
00:51:19,076 --> 00:51:20,441
We need to talk.

578
00:51:21,378 --> 00:51:24,814
About what?
You're scaring me.

579
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:39,929
This is very important
for me.

580
00:51:41,465 --> 00:51:43,330
Be honest with me.

581
00:51:43,467 --> 00:51:44,729
Okay.

582
00:51:44,868 --> 00:51:46,426
You swear?

583
00:51:46,570 --> 00:51:47,434
I do.

584
00:51:47,571 --> 00:51:49,038
On your parents' names?

585
00:51:50,474 --> 00:51:51,634
Okay.

586
00:51:53,877 --> 00:51:58,610
Are you getting married
next month?

587
00:51:59,883 --> 00:52:01,043
Yes.

588
00:52:01,852 --> 00:52:03,012
I am.

589
00:52:15,966 --> 00:52:17,126
Good for you.

590
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:21,733
I'm gonna go.

591
00:52:26,576 --> 00:52:27,838
Wait!

592
00:52:35,552 --> 00:52:39,716
I'll forget the whole thing.

593
00:52:40,357 --> 00:52:42,018
Buy me raw fish.

594
00:52:42,959 --> 00:52:46,224
I'm busy with
wedding arrangements.

595
00:52:51,801 --> 00:52:54,292
You're really something.

596
00:52:55,872 --> 00:52:58,136
I feel like I've been used.

597
00:52:58,875 --> 00:53:00,843
You don't mind hurting others.

598
00:53:00,977 --> 00:53:03,309
But you're so self-protective.

599
00:53:06,550 --> 00:53:09,212
I've been truthful
with my feelings all along.

600
00:53:09,452 --> 00:53:11,420
That is exactly why.

601
00:53:11,555 --> 00:53:14,922
That's why
I'm hurting so much now!

602
00:53:26,469 --> 00:53:28,027
You don't like it?

603
00:53:28,171 --> 00:53:29,138
I do.

604
00:53:29,272 --> 00:53:30,637
Why aren't you eating then?

605
00:53:34,077 --> 00:53:36,443
Can we move to the room?

606
00:53:36,646 --> 00:53:37,305
Why?

607
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:40,540
Let's move to the room.

608
00:53:42,052 --> 00:53:43,212
Excuse me?

609
00:53:48,658 --> 00:53:50,922
You don't like it crowded?

610
00:53:53,663 --> 00:53:54,823
No.

611
00:53:55,065 --> 00:54:00,230
My hands become so shaky
that I can't even eat.

612
00:54:01,471 --> 00:54:02,836
Same for me.

613
00:54:03,073 --> 00:54:07,237
Let me tell you.
I can't even fly.

614
00:54:07,377 --> 00:54:08,742
Like it's gonna kill me.

615
00:54:08,878 --> 00:54:10,903
That's the case
when I'm on the subway.

616
00:54:11,047 --> 00:54:14,312
Should we visit
the nuthouse together?

617
00:54:14,451 --> 00:54:15,509
Can we?

618
00:54:15,652 --> 00:54:18,018
I've always wanted to.

619
00:54:18,154 --> 00:54:21,419
But I thought I'd really go crazy
if I went alone.

620
00:54:28,398 --> 00:54:34,268
<i>I don't trust a guy who says,</i>
<i>"I love you. "</i>

621
00:54:34,437 --> 00:54:35,597
<i>Why not?</i>

622
00:54:36,273 --> 00:54:39,834
<i>I had this friend in college. </i>

623
00:54:39,976 --> 00:54:42,740
<i>She fell in love</i>
<i>with the assistant professor. </i>

624
00:54:43,546 --> 00:54:45,013
<i>He was handsome, attractive... </i>

625
00:54:46,650 --> 00:54:48,709
<i>and married. </i>

626
00:54:51,354 --> 00:54:54,619
<i>And you know what was worse?</i>

627
00:54:54,758 --> 00:54:58,216
<i>She wasn't the only student</i>
<i>he was seeing. </i>

628
00:55:00,163 --> 00:55:02,324
<i>And he took money from her</i>
<i>and other girls. </i>

629
00:55:02,465 --> 00:55:03,830
It's a typical story.

630
00:55:05,368 --> 00:55:06,926
Right.

631
00:55:07,070 --> 00:55:08,230
Isn't it?

632
00:55:09,873 --> 00:55:13,331
She was so stupid
to fall for a guy like that.

633
00:55:15,478 --> 00:55:19,414
Then he made up stories

634
00:55:19,549 --> 00:55:21,312
that made her look like a psycho.

635
00:55:21,451 --> 00:55:23,419
So she had to drop out.

636
00:55:24,954 --> 00:55:26,114
Why did he?

637
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:34,919
Because she wouldn't let him
get away with it.

638
00:55:37,701 --> 00:55:43,333
Still, how could he do that?
He once liked her.

639
00:55:45,475 --> 00:55:49,036
If you're married
and date your student,

640
00:55:50,046 --> 00:55:56,212
they won't give you tenure
due to the moral issues.

641
00:55:56,532 --> 00:55:58,693
So he made up stories

642
00:56:00,435 --> 00:56:02,903
that my friend had seduced her

643
00:56:05,541 --> 00:56:08,203
and stalked him around.

644
00:56:09,144 --> 00:56:10,304
What a dick.

645
00:56:11,847 --> 00:56:14,611
What happened to her?

646
00:56:16,051 --> 00:56:17,211
She's dead.

647
00:56:18,053 --> 00:56:20,419
She jumped
off a building.

648
00:56:22,558 --> 00:56:27,188
She killed herself over a guy?

649
00:56:28,830 --> 00:56:31,594
I don't think
you know girls well.

650
00:56:33,035 --> 00:56:35,196
I don't understand.

651
00:56:39,241 --> 00:56:41,300
I feel sorry for her.

652
00:56:42,044 --> 00:56:46,208
She was deceived by a dick
and killed herself for that?

653
00:56:49,451 --> 00:56:52,716
I bet no guy can deceive you.

654
00:56:53,555 --> 00:56:54,715
You're strong.

655
00:56:55,557 --> 00:56:56,717
Right?

656
00:56:59,127 --> 00:57:00,094
Yeah.

657
00:57:09,938 --> 00:57:11,599
You love him?

658
00:57:15,143 --> 00:57:16,508
No.

659
00:57:16,645 --> 00:57:18,613
I don't love anybody.

660
00:57:21,149 --> 00:57:22,810
Why marry him then?

661
00:57:24,853 --> 00:57:30,792
He's stable, successful,
and nice to me.

662
00:57:31,426 --> 00:57:32,984
That's what matters.

663
00:57:35,530 --> 00:57:39,193
So go back to your girlfriend.

664
00:57:41,136 --> 00:57:42,603
What we're doing...

665
00:57:44,039 --> 00:57:48,806
It's nothing but a fling,
and won't last for long.

666
00:57:50,045 --> 00:57:51,808
You know that, don't you?

667
00:58:27,616 --> 00:58:29,083
Hello?

668
00:58:31,019 --> 00:58:32,384
Checking out?

669
00:58:35,057 --> 00:58:37,389
God!
Where am I?

670
00:58:41,630 --> 00:58:43,188
What happened?

671
00:58:47,736 --> 00:58:49,499
Did you rape me?

672
00:58:49,638 --> 00:58:50,900
What are you talking about?

673
00:58:51,039 --> 00:58:53,098
We agreed to call it quits.

674
00:58:53,241 --> 00:58:54,799
Don't put this on me.

675
00:58:54,943 --> 00:58:57,605
I have no idea
how we ended up here.

676
00:58:59,147 --> 00:59:00,614
Where's my underwear?

677
00:59:05,454 --> 00:59:08,514
A lot of motels here.

678
00:59:11,727 --> 00:59:16,289
You can come back later
with your boyfriend.

679
00:59:17,966 --> 00:59:22,733
Is there a motel
that you guys patronize?

680
00:59:23,238 --> 00:59:24,398
We don't go to one.

681
00:59:25,741 --> 00:59:28,301
You do it at home?

682
00:59:29,144 --> 00:59:31,908
He's never been to my place.

683
00:59:32,647 --> 00:59:35,013
Really?
For 3 years?

684
00:59:35,150 --> 00:59:36,310
Yes.

685
00:59:38,553 --> 00:59:39,713
Why not?

686
00:59:40,155 --> 00:59:43,124
I never bring guys home.

687
00:59:44,126 --> 00:59:46,492
You're strange.

688
00:59:46,628 --> 00:59:49,188
Then where do you do it?

689
00:59:49,331 --> 00:59:52,391
I hear some give you points
like frequent flyer.

690
00:59:52,534 --> 00:59:54,195
Stay 10 nights and get 1 free

691
00:59:58,540 --> 01:00:00,906
You often go to a motel?

692
01:00:01,042 --> 01:00:02,509
No,

693
01:00:02,644 --> 01:00:05,306
it's been a few years.

694
01:00:06,248 --> 01:00:07,408
Why?

695
01:00:08,850 --> 01:00:12,513
I want to,
but she hates it.

696
01:00:12,721 --> 01:00:13,881
Why?

697
01:00:14,456 --> 01:00:19,086
She hates using sheets
somebody else has used.

698
01:00:19,227 --> 01:00:22,788
She's anal in that aspect.

699
01:00:24,533 --> 01:00:27,798
Maybe she doesn't like doing it
with you.

700
01:00:27,936 --> 01:00:31,099
Come on, that's not it.

701
01:00:31,540 --> 01:00:34,805
She's not like others.

702
01:00:34,943 --> 01:00:39,403
She's a bit rigid
and doesn't like sex.

703
01:00:40,849 --> 01:00:42,908
Who doesn't like sex?

704
01:00:43,185 --> 01:00:44,345
My girlfriend.

705
01:00:44,986 --> 01:00:47,716
She can't even imagine herself
naked with another guy.

706
01:00:47,856 --> 01:00:50,290
She think it's dirty.

707
01:00:51,126 --> 01:00:52,593
She's coy.

708
01:00:53,528 --> 01:00:56,691
I don't think you know
your girlfriend well enough.

709
01:01:00,335 --> 01:01:02,895
Not everybody is like you.

710
01:01:03,738 --> 01:01:07,299
Some like you are open
about sex.

711
01:01:07,442 --> 01:01:10,809
And others hate it naturally.

712
01:01:10,946 --> 01:01:12,709
Everybody's different.

713
01:01:19,354 --> 01:01:21,618
You officially raped me.

714
01:01:23,925 --> 01:01:25,085
CHOI!

715
01:01:25,827 --> 01:01:28,694
We were hugging in bed.

716
01:01:28,830 --> 01:01:30,593
You call that rape?

717
01:01:31,333 --> 01:01:32,493
It's love!

718
01:01:34,236 --> 01:01:36,500
Ditch him ASAP.

719
01:01:36,638 --> 01:01:39,505
They'll study characteristics of

720
01:01:39,641 --> 01:01:41,609
of different celestial spheres.

721
01:01:41,743 --> 01:01:45,201
In the introductory lesson,
the students will...

722
01:01:45,347 --> 01:01:49,408
<i>We're having a meeting. </i>
<i>Where are you?</i>

723
01:01:49,551 --> 01:01:53,214
And encourage the students
to present about the...

724
01:01:55,757 --> 01:01:59,887
<i>Why aren't you</i>
<i>answering the phone?</i>

725
01:02:01,329 --> 01:02:02,489
<i>Hello?</i>

726
01:02:03,064 --> 01:02:05,396
<i>Hello? Hello?</i>

727
01:02:05,533 --> 01:02:07,398
<i>Why is your cell phone off?</i>

728
01:02:07,535 --> 01:02:09,594
<i>CHOI, pick up. </i>

729
01:02:09,738 --> 01:02:12,104
<i>I'm worried about you. </i>

730
01:02:12,240 --> 01:02:13,707
<i>Are you sick?</i>

731
01:02:13,842 --> 01:02:15,605
<i>Is that it?</i>

732
01:02:16,144 --> 01:02:18,510
<i>God, this is ridiculous. </i>

733
01:02:18,647 --> 01:02:21,013
<i>Come on, pick up!</i>

734
01:02:21,149 --> 01:02:23,617
<i>This is too much. </i>
<i>You should've called in sick. </i>

735
01:02:23,752 --> 01:02:25,310
<i>You're making me upset. </i>

736
01:02:40,735 --> 01:02:41,895
<i>Personnel Records</i>

737
01:02:42,037 --> 01:02:44,403
How could you do that?

738
01:02:45,340 --> 01:02:46,898
It's a job!

739
01:02:47,042 --> 01:02:49,704
You can't just skip a day
without notice.

740
01:02:53,915 --> 01:02:55,075
This is right.

741
01:02:59,354 --> 01:03:01,117
Is she out?

742
01:03:20,342 --> 01:03:21,707
I see it!

743
01:03:23,345 --> 01:03:26,508
That's your bag, isn't it?

744
01:03:28,149 --> 01:03:31,016
You drank beer alone?

745
01:03:31,853 --> 01:03:33,218
You're so funny.

746
01:03:36,925 --> 01:03:38,187
Damn!

747
01:03:39,627 --> 01:03:43,996
CHOI, I'm cold and hungry.

748
01:03:45,133 --> 01:03:46,600
Are you with him?

749
01:03:52,841 --> 01:03:55,901
Should I report to the principle
that you quit?

750
01:03:56,344 --> 01:03:59,211
Once I do, that's it.

751
01:03:59,948 --> 01:04:03,008
If you get an F for this,
you can't even graduate.

752
01:04:03,318 --> 01:04:06,287
I'll count to three.

753
01:04:06,454 --> 01:04:07,512
If I leave, you're in trouble.

754
01:04:08,656 --> 01:04:09,816
One.

755
01:04:11,459 --> 01:04:12,517
Two.

756
01:04:14,763 --> 01:04:15,923
Three!

757
01:04:28,943 --> 01:04:31,503
I can't believe
I have no mirror in the car.

758
01:04:33,148 --> 01:04:34,308
Damn!

759
01:04:35,550 --> 01:04:36,710
Damn it!

760
01:04:58,139 --> 01:04:59,299
There!

761
01:05:00,542 --> 01:05:01,702
I see you!

762
01:05:03,645 --> 01:05:04,805
CHOI!

763
01:05:06,347 --> 01:05:08,815
You can't hide
under the blanket!

764
01:05:10,952 --> 01:05:13,420
Does your girlfriend know
about this?

765
01:05:14,355 --> 01:05:15,515
No.

766
01:05:16,157 --> 01:05:18,387
Don't you feel guilty?

767
01:05:20,929 --> 01:05:22,692
Why are you saying that?

768
01:05:23,031 --> 01:05:24,692
You don't know?

769
01:05:24,933 --> 01:05:27,902
Look, think about it.

770
01:05:28,436 --> 01:05:33,032
I'm not asking you
to marry me, am I?

771
01:05:33,141 --> 01:05:35,006
We'll just date.

772
01:05:35,343 --> 01:05:36,810
It's no big deal.

773
01:05:37,045 --> 01:05:41,004
We'll spend time together
and have fun.

774
01:05:42,050 --> 01:05:44,018
Get permission from her then.

775
01:05:45,153 --> 01:05:47,018
How can I?

776
01:05:47,155 --> 01:05:50,784
She will pull my hair out
once she finds out.

777
01:05:50,925 --> 01:05:54,486
That's what I am saying.
You need to stop this.

778
01:05:56,331 --> 01:05:59,391
I don't wanna do this either.

779
01:05:59,534 --> 01:06:01,001
But I can't help it.

780
01:06:01,136 --> 01:06:02,296
Let it go.

781
01:06:03,338 --> 01:06:04,498
Don't do this.

782
01:06:05,640 --> 01:06:09,508
Or give me a grace period.

783
01:06:09,644 --> 01:06:10,303
What?

784
01:06:10,445 --> 01:06:12,504
Time to forget you.

785
01:06:13,548 --> 01:06:15,607
I can't live like this.

786
01:06:15,750 --> 01:06:17,308
I can't do anything.

787
01:06:17,452 --> 01:06:19,113
Until the first snowfall.

788
01:06:19,254 --> 01:06:22,018
It's only a few months away.

789
01:06:22,157 --> 01:06:23,681
How about it?

790
01:06:24,526 --> 01:06:27,689
Then you don't have
to break up with him.

791
01:06:27,829 --> 01:06:30,798
I'll try to forget you.
I promise.

792
01:06:31,032 --> 01:06:34,297
I won't bother you then.

793
01:06:35,737 --> 01:06:36,897
Then...

794
01:06:38,339 --> 01:06:40,500
What if I do by then?

795
01:06:40,642 --> 01:06:41,904
What?

796
01:06:42,043 --> 01:06:43,601
What if I bother you?

797
01:06:44,646 --> 01:06:45,806
What then?

798
01:06:47,348 --> 01:06:49,111
Any plan for that?

799
01:06:50,451 --> 01:06:53,215
If so...

800
01:06:54,556 --> 01:06:56,888
I'll give you a grace period.

801
01:06:59,027 --> 01:07:00,688
Like until the spring.

802
01:07:00,828 --> 01:07:02,090
Forget it.

803
01:07:02,230 --> 01:07:03,697
Come on!

804
01:07:03,831 --> 01:07:06,994
You don't want me
to make a scene, do you?

805
01:07:10,038 --> 01:07:11,198
What is this?

806
01:07:12,140 --> 01:07:16,509
You told me to wait here
and took a shower?

807
01:07:16,644 --> 01:07:20,205
Your hair is wet!
Do you know how long I waited?

808
01:07:20,348 --> 01:07:21,815
Let's go.

809
01:07:21,950 --> 01:07:23,110
Where?

810
01:07:24,052 --> 01:07:25,417
To talk.

811
01:07:28,122 --> 01:07:30,022
Let's go to your place.

812
01:07:30,925 --> 01:07:33,985
No way.
Let's go to a cafe.

813
01:07:34,128 --> 01:07:35,390
My legs hurt.

814
01:07:42,237 --> 01:07:43,397
Hey!

815
01:07:50,245 --> 01:07:52,110
Nice.

816
01:07:55,250 --> 01:07:56,717
Bigger than my room.

817
01:07:57,652 --> 01:07:59,711
Get out of here now.

818
01:07:59,854 --> 01:08:02,015
Are you out of your mind?

819
01:08:02,156 --> 01:08:03,214
Wait,

820
01:08:03,358 --> 01:08:05,383
you cleaned too?

821
01:08:05,526 --> 01:08:06,993
While I was waiting outside,

822
01:08:07,128 --> 01:08:10,586
you showered and cleaned?

823
01:08:10,732 --> 01:08:11,892
LEE!

824
01:08:14,335 --> 01:08:15,393
Okay.

825
01:08:15,536 --> 01:08:16,901
Give me some coffee.

826
01:08:20,441 --> 01:08:21,601
How nice!

827
01:08:25,346 --> 01:08:28,713
It's all dried up.
You don't paint any more?

828
01:08:28,950 --> 01:08:30,110
No.

829
01:08:34,155 --> 01:08:35,417
What's this?

830
01:08:36,424 --> 01:08:38,756
I drew it long ago.

831
01:08:41,062 --> 01:08:42,893
You're an artist.

832
01:08:43,031 --> 01:08:44,396
Stop it.

833
01:08:44,532 --> 01:08:49,196
You're better
than our art teacher.

834
01:08:49,337 --> 01:08:51,703
You could've been a great artist.

835
01:08:57,245 --> 01:09:00,214
Why don't you come up here?

836
01:09:00,348 --> 01:09:01,815
It's okay.

837
01:09:01,949 --> 01:09:04,008
It's getting late.
Aren't you going home?

838
01:09:12,327 --> 01:09:13,794
Why?

839
01:09:14,329 --> 01:09:16,593
I have to return it tonight.

840
01:09:17,131 --> 01:09:19,793
Come up here
and sit next to me.

841
01:09:19,934 --> 01:09:21,401
I'll turn it back on then.

842
01:09:40,154 --> 01:09:41,519
This is nice.

843
01:09:43,725 --> 01:09:44,885
Move your head.

844
01:09:46,527 --> 01:09:47,789
I don't want to.

845
01:09:48,730 --> 01:09:49,890
Wait!

846
01:10:18,426 --> 01:10:20,690
<i>I'm going to be late. </i>
<i>Don't wait. </i>

847
01:10:29,370 --> 01:10:31,463
Once a year?

848
01:10:32,206 --> 01:10:35,300
They have sex only once a year.

849
01:10:35,443 --> 01:10:37,502
And today must be it.

850
01:12:00,828 --> 01:12:02,090
<i>Hello?</i>

851
01:12:02,230 --> 01:12:04,790
<i>Don't hang up. </i>

852
01:12:05,533 --> 01:12:08,696
<i>You're killing me. </i>

853
01:12:09,136 --> 01:12:12,299
<i>It's not true, is it?</i>

854
01:12:14,041 --> 01:12:16,100
<i>They say I seduced</i>

855
01:12:16,844 --> 01:12:20,507
<i>and stalked you. </i>

856
01:12:21,649 --> 01:12:24,311
<i>They say you said that. </i>

857
01:12:25,453 --> 01:12:26,920
<i>You didn't, did you?</i>

858
01:12:29,657 --> 01:12:30,783
CHOI?

859
01:12:31,425 --> 01:12:32,585
No fun, is it?

860
01:12:33,728 --> 01:12:35,696
Yeah, I'm having fun.

861
01:12:35,830 --> 01:12:38,697
I don't think so.

862
01:12:38,833 --> 01:12:41,700
You teach, right?

863
01:12:41,836 --> 01:12:43,497
No, that's...

864
01:12:43,638 --> 01:12:44,798
Yeah

865
01:12:44,939 --> 01:12:46,804
She teaches
geography at Gyungll.

866
01:12:46,941 --> 01:12:48,499
Oh...

867
01:12:48,643 --> 01:12:50,702
Isn't that school
in a poor area?

868
01:12:50,845 --> 01:12:55,475
Right, but she's moving soon
to Jell High.

869
01:12:55,650 --> 01:12:57,515
That's a good school.

870
01:12:57,652 --> 01:12:59,119
What college did you go to?

871
01:12:59,854 --> 01:13:02,618
One in Seoul.

872
01:13:02,757 --> 01:13:06,284
Her father runs a big farm
down in the south.

873
01:13:06,427 --> 01:13:07,587
Wow...

874
01:13:09,030 --> 01:13:11,396
<i>I truly loved you. </i>

875
01:13:11,532 --> 01:13:12,999
<i>What do you call this then?</i>

876
01:13:15,436 --> 01:13:20,999
<i>You have no idea</i>
<i>what you're putting me through. </i>

877
01:13:21,742 --> 01:13:24,711
<i>You told me you loved me. </i>

878
01:13:24,845 --> 01:13:29,805
<i>We were drunk and got caught up</i>
<i>in the moment. </i>

879
01:13:29,951 --> 01:13:32,818
<i>How could you do this to me?</i>

880
01:13:35,056 --> 01:13:37,286
<i>What does your heart say?</i>

881
01:13:38,225 --> 01:13:41,888
<i>I have to go. </i>

882
01:13:42,930 --> 01:13:47,993
<i>I'll pay you back what I owe you. </i>

883
01:13:48,135 --> 01:13:52,094
<i>You slept with me. </i>
<i>What am I supposed to do?</i>

884
01:13:52,239 --> 01:13:57,802
<i>Damn, keep it up</i>
<i>and I'll have you expelled. </i>

885
01:13:57,945 --> 01:14:00,413
<i>They won't believe you. </i>

886
01:14:00,548 --> 01:14:04,507
<i>You told them I was a stalker. </i>

887
01:14:04,652 --> 01:14:08,315
<i>You told them</i>
<i>to watch out for me. </i>

888
01:14:08,456 --> 01:14:11,289
<i>I give the school a bad name. </i>

889
01:14:14,428 --> 01:14:18,990
<i>I understand</i>
<i>why you're doing this. </i>

890
01:14:20,334 --> 01:14:22,097
<i>But it's breaking my heart. </i>

891
01:14:25,840 --> 01:14:27,501
<i>It hurts me so much. </i>

892
01:14:41,188 --> 01:14:45,026
You're so late.
I was freezing to death.

893
01:14:45,061 --> 01:14:45,856
You have no umbrella.

894
01:14:46,027 --> 01:14:47,289
Why didn't you go?

895
01:14:47,428 --> 01:14:49,293
I missed you.

896
01:14:49,430 --> 01:14:50,692
Let go.

897
01:14:52,633 --> 01:14:54,191
You're getting wet.

898
01:14:54,335 --> 01:14:55,302
Cut it out.

899
01:14:56,037 --> 01:14:58,597
I'm in a bad mood.

900
01:14:58,739 --> 01:15:00,104
So leave.

901
01:15:05,546 --> 01:15:09,004
Let's drink.
I bought some.

902
01:15:21,429 --> 01:15:26,799
That girl who jumped
off the building...

903
01:15:28,736 --> 01:15:30,499
That's you, isn't it?

904
01:15:32,640 --> 01:15:33,800
So you...

905
01:15:35,543 --> 01:15:37,408
You were left with a broken heart.

906
01:15:48,055 --> 01:15:49,522
Are you crying?

907
01:15:50,124 --> 01:15:51,489
Are you?

908
01:15:53,027 --> 01:15:54,688
Let me look at you.

909
01:16:01,936 --> 01:16:03,494
You went through my stuff?

910
01:16:06,340 --> 01:16:08,103
I didn't mean to.

911
01:16:09,143 --> 01:16:10,303
Bastard!

912
01:16:13,748 --> 01:16:16,512
You're not over him yet?

913
01:16:16,751 --> 01:16:18,912
Says who?

914
01:16:19,053 --> 01:16:20,418
Why cry then?

915
01:16:22,456 --> 01:16:25,687
Because I'm so upset
with myself.

916
01:16:27,928 --> 01:16:30,692
It means you still have
feelings for him.

917
01:16:32,633 --> 01:16:35,193
You still love him, don't you?

918
01:16:35,336 --> 01:16:36,496
Asshole!

919
01:16:37,738 --> 01:16:42,198
You recorded it to cherish it,
or what?

920
01:16:42,343 --> 01:16:43,503
I recorded it...

921
01:16:44,645 --> 01:16:47,614
...to leave evidence
that he stole from me.

922
01:16:47,748 --> 01:16:49,807
But you didn't mention
anything about money.

923
01:16:50,851 --> 01:16:54,218
"What does your heart say?"

924
01:16:54,355 --> 01:16:56,880
You were crying for love.

925
01:17:00,327 --> 01:17:02,887
Why are you telling me this?

926
01:17:05,733 --> 01:17:06,893
Just because.

927
01:17:07,434 --> 01:17:08,992
You're pathetic.

928
01:17:10,437 --> 01:17:13,406
I can't believe
you're not over a jerk like him.

929
01:17:16,644 --> 01:17:17,906
Get out!

930
01:17:18,045 --> 01:17:19,103
Go away!

931
01:17:19,246 --> 01:17:20,406
What?

932
01:17:20,548 --> 01:17:22,106
Get the hell out.

933
01:17:22,249 --> 01:17:23,910
What'd I do wrong?

934
01:17:25,252 --> 01:17:26,310
Get out, asshole!

935
01:17:26,453 --> 01:17:28,921
Look at yourself.

936
01:17:29,056 --> 01:17:33,390
You're still in love with a man
who didn't even love you.

937
01:17:34,228 --> 01:17:36,594
Crying out of missing him...

938
01:17:36,831 --> 01:17:38,799
You think I miss him?

939
01:17:39,233 --> 01:17:41,599
If not, why cry?

940
01:17:42,236 --> 01:17:45,694
Say you broke up
with your girlfriend.

941
01:17:45,840 --> 01:17:47,808
She made up stories

942
01:17:49,443 --> 01:17:51,809
to turn you into a stalker.

943
01:17:52,246 --> 01:17:54,806
And you got fired.

944
01:17:54,949 --> 01:17:57,110
How would you feel?

945
01:17:58,052 --> 01:17:59,519
Because of him,

946
01:17:59,653 --> 01:18:02,213
I'm working under you
as a student teacher.

947
01:18:03,924 --> 01:18:08,588
I can't even sleep at night

948
01:18:09,129 --> 01:18:13,293
because the pain is so unbearable.

949
01:18:16,036 --> 01:18:18,300
You think I'm not over him?

950
01:18:21,642 --> 01:18:24,509
I would cut off his limb
if I could.

951
01:18:24,945 --> 01:18:28,813
His wife and the kids...

952
01:18:28,949 --> 01:18:30,610
I want to kill them all!

953
01:18:32,653 --> 01:18:34,314
He didn't like you.

954
01:18:34,455 --> 01:18:36,685
He just fucked you.

955
01:18:39,226 --> 01:18:41,786
You're no different.

956
01:18:41,929 --> 01:18:43,089
What?

957
01:18:43,464 --> 01:18:46,900
Nothing but leeches
sucking blood out of girls.

958
01:18:47,034 --> 01:18:49,400
What the fuck did you say?

959
01:18:49,637 --> 01:18:52,105
You just wanted to fuck me.
So did he.

960
01:18:52,239 --> 01:18:54,207
You two are no different!

961
01:18:55,142 --> 01:18:56,404
Fuck!

962
01:18:57,444 --> 01:18:58,103
Asshole.

963
01:18:58,245 --> 01:19:01,908
Why the fuck are you
taking it out on me?

964
01:19:02,049 --> 01:19:04,017
Say that to him.

965
01:19:04,151 --> 01:19:07,018
Tell him he's a fucking leech
to his face!

966
01:19:08,956 --> 01:19:10,583
Get out of here.

967
01:19:10,724 --> 01:19:11,782
Beat it.

968
01:19:11,926 --> 01:19:13,484
Your lies disgust me.
Get the hell out!

969
01:19:13,627 --> 01:19:15,788
Yeah, I'm fucking leaving.

970
01:19:30,544 --> 01:19:34,378
You really don't know
why I'm doing this?

971
01:19:35,449 --> 01:19:37,508
Get out of my face.

972
01:20:24,231 --> 01:20:25,391
Where are you?

973
01:20:29,937 --> 01:20:33,202
The art teacher at your school
went to KwangJin Univ, right?

974
01:20:33,340 --> 01:20:34,500
Yes.

975
01:20:35,542 --> 01:20:37,703
Find out about
the assistant professor.

976
01:20:39,346 --> 01:20:40,506
Why?

977
01:20:41,548 --> 01:20:44,517
Somebody asked me.

978
01:20:44,752 --> 01:20:46,310
Who?

979
01:20:46,420 --> 01:20:47,887
It's just...

980
01:20:49,156 --> 01:20:50,885
I hear he's an asshole.

981
01:20:51,925 --> 01:20:56,191
He takes money from his students
and all that.

982
01:20:56,430 --> 01:20:57,590
So what?

983
01:20:59,933 --> 01:21:03,994
I just want to see
what that asshole looks like.

984
01:21:14,148 --> 01:21:16,412
<i>I can't sleep. </i>
<i>I need you. </i>

985
01:21:19,753 --> 01:21:23,018
Hui-jung, I have to go.

986
01:21:23,257 --> 01:21:24,690
See you later.

987
01:21:25,125 --> 01:21:27,593
- Yu-lim!
- I'll Tell you later.

988
01:21:27,728 --> 01:21:28,888
Bye!

989
01:21:38,739 --> 01:21:40,206
I can't find your place.

990
01:21:40,340 --> 01:21:41,898
<i>Where are you?</i>

991
01:21:42,743 --> 01:21:44,506
<i>You were here yesterday. </i>

992
01:21:46,447 --> 01:21:50,508
It's dark and pissing rain.

993
01:21:51,051 --> 01:21:53,110
Meet me outside your place.

994
01:22:40,734 --> 01:22:41,894
What?

995
01:22:42,936 --> 01:22:46,099
You sure you have insomnia?

996
01:22:47,241 --> 01:22:48,799
You sleep like a log!

997
01:22:50,544 --> 01:22:51,704
I don't know.

998
01:22:53,447 --> 01:22:58,817
You make me sleepy.
What perfume is this?

999
01:22:58,952 --> 01:23:00,317
I don't wear it.

1000
01:23:01,655 --> 01:23:02,815
But I can feel it.

1001
01:23:03,524 --> 01:23:05,685
You always smell good.

1002
01:23:08,228 --> 01:23:11,994
It makes me drowsy.

1003
01:23:13,333 --> 01:23:16,894
I've never slept well
since I moved to Seoul.

1004
01:23:17,938 --> 01:23:23,001
With the lights off,
I have bad dreams.

1005
01:23:23,143 --> 01:23:27,705
With the lights on, it feels like
someone's watching me.

1006
01:23:27,848 --> 01:23:30,214
So I stay up through the night.

1007
01:23:31,852 --> 01:23:33,012
Anyway...

1008
01:23:33,654 --> 01:23:37,385
It's so nice
that I can sleep tight.

1009
01:23:39,226 --> 01:23:41,285
What are you saying?

1010
01:23:43,330 --> 01:23:44,888
You don't like me.

1011
01:23:46,333 --> 01:23:48,995
I help you sleep well.

1012
01:23:49,136 --> 01:23:51,696
So you're using me, right?

1013
01:23:51,838 --> 01:23:55,103
Exactly.
That's what you're good for.

1014
01:24:19,032 --> 01:24:20,192
Hand.

1015
01:24:23,136 --> 01:24:24,296
Forget it.

1016
01:24:30,911 --> 01:24:33,675
Why can't we get off
in front of the school?

1017
01:24:34,047 --> 01:24:36,914
It's a 20-minuite-walk
from here.

1018
01:24:37,251 --> 01:24:39,412
What if people see us?

1019
01:24:39,553 --> 01:24:41,714
We'll tell them
we just shared the cab.

1020
01:24:41,855 --> 01:24:43,584
I'll walk then.

1021
01:24:56,036 --> 01:24:57,594
He's not here yet?

1022
01:24:57,938 --> 01:24:59,098
No.

1023
01:24:59,239 --> 01:25:03,505
If the principle finds out,
he's in big trouble.

1024
01:25:04,444 --> 01:25:05,809
Let's go.

1025
01:25:08,849 --> 01:25:10,908
Good morning!

1026
01:25:11,551 --> 01:25:15,817
What time do you think it is?
You're always late.

1027
01:25:16,657 --> 01:25:19,592
- Oh, You're early.
- Yes.

1028
01:25:40,047 --> 01:25:43,107
I hear your eye rolling.

1029
01:25:44,451 --> 01:25:46,009
No cheating, okay?

1030
01:25:54,227 --> 01:25:58,596
They hang out here.
This is like their hideout.

1031
01:26:02,336 --> 01:26:04,201
I often come here
and smoke their cigarettes.

1032
01:26:05,038 --> 01:26:06,903
It reminds me of the old days.

1033
01:26:09,343 --> 01:26:13,211
We can pack a lunch and eat here.

1034
01:26:13,847 --> 01:26:17,908
Why don't you?
How about sweet and sour chicken?

1035
01:26:18,051 --> 01:26:19,916
No chicken.

1036
01:26:20,053 --> 01:26:22,419
I can't even touch it.

1037
01:26:22,556 --> 01:26:24,080
Just thinking about it...

1038
01:26:35,435 --> 01:26:36,993
Didn't you hear it?

1039
01:26:38,638 --> 01:26:39,605
I heard something.

1040
01:26:39,906 --> 01:26:41,373
What?

1041
01:26:42,042 --> 01:26:43,407
I bet I heard it.

1042
01:26:44,644 --> 01:26:47,010
Hey, cigarettes are gone!

1043
01:26:47,848 --> 01:26:49,816
Who could it be?

1044
01:26:50,150 --> 01:26:51,515
I bet it's those guys again.

1045
01:26:51,651 --> 01:26:52,515
Again?

1046
01:26:52,652 --> 01:26:55,120
We should teach them a lesson.

1047
01:26:55,856 --> 01:26:56,982
Let's kick their asses!

1048
01:27:10,971 --> 01:27:12,131
Hand!

1049
01:27:14,841 --> 01:27:16,001
Hand!

1050
01:27:31,324 --> 01:27:32,791

1060
01:28:18,038 --> 01:28:20,802
Okay, fine.
Let me pee first.

1061
01:28:26,847 --> 01:28:30,510
There's a rumor at school.

1062
01:28:31,151 --> 01:28:32,209
What rumor?

1063
01:28:32,352 --> 01:28:33,512
So funny.

1064
01:28:34,754 --> 01:28:38,281
That you and CHOI are
going out.

1065
01:28:41,728 --> 01:28:43,195
- Really?
- Yes.

1066
01:28:48,535 --> 01:28:51,732
We were being careful.
How'd they find out?

1067
01:28:52,839 --> 01:28:54,807
The kids these days are
so quick.

1068
01:28:57,344 --> 01:28:58,106
What?

1069
01:28:58,245 --> 01:28:59,405
Let me tell you.

1070
01:29:00,747 --> 01:29:02,305
I like her.

1071
01:29:06,253 --> 01:29:07,618
Asshole!

1072
01:29:08,555 --> 01:29:10,386
How can you do that?

1073
01:29:10,524 --> 01:29:11,684
What?

1074
01:29:12,425 --> 01:29:17,886
You have Hui-jung.
She's like family to me.

1075
01:29:19,132 --> 01:29:20,292
CHO.

1076
01:29:22,135 --> 01:29:23,693
It's hard for me too.

1077
01:29:24,938 --> 01:29:25,996
You...

1078
01:29:26,139 --> 01:29:28,607
You can't do this to her.

1079
01:29:29,743 --> 01:29:31,711
You can't.

1080
01:29:31,978 --> 01:29:33,138
Son of a bitch!

1081
01:29:37,751 --> 01:29:40,117
I don't know what to do!

1082
01:29:58,438 --> 01:29:59,598
CHO.

1083
01:30:01,441 --> 01:30:03,204
It hurt a lot.

1084
01:30:06,146 --> 01:30:08,910
I thought you broke my jaw.

1085
01:30:09,049 --> 01:30:10,607
Did you drink a lot?

1086
01:30:11,651 --> 01:30:12,811
You son of a...

1087
01:30:20,327 --> 01:30:21,191
CHO,

1088
01:30:22,429 --> 01:30:24,829
This isn't easy for me either.

1089
01:30:25,031 --> 01:30:25,690
What am I...

1090
01:30:25,832 --> 01:30:28,300
Shut up

1091
01:30:28,435 --> 01:30:30,903
and check out
the school website.

1092
01:30:32,739 --> 01:30:33,899
What for?

1093
01:30:34,341 --> 01:30:36,002
Just do it, asshole.

1094
01:30:40,447 --> 01:30:42,108
Stop lying, man.

1095
01:30:43,750 --> 01:30:45,012
You're such a bluff.

1096
01:30:45,852 --> 01:30:47,012
Guys, it's HONG.

1097
01:30:47,754 --> 01:30:49,813
Hi!

1098
01:30:49,956 --> 01:30:52,789
What are you doing here?

1099
01:30:52,926 --> 01:30:55,190
Let me tell you.

1100
01:30:55,328 --> 01:30:57,193
You have beautiful legs.

1101
01:30:57,330 --> 01:31:00,299
They look like frog legs
from a distance.

- No, you don't have to.

you're all expelled.

1119

If you lie, you'll get expelled.

1124

- Got that?
- Yes.

1125
01:33:06,893 --> 01:33:10,056
The student teacher of your class
said that?

1126
01:33:10,330 --> 01:33:12,491
Why'd she tell you that?

1127
01:33:12,632 --> 01:33:14,190
That's not it.

1128
01:33:14,334 --> 01:33:16,598
What is it then?

1129
01:33:16,736 --> 01:33:18,601
I overheard it
in the faculties' bathroom.

1130
01:33:18,738 --> 01:33:20,501
What were you doing there?

1131
01:33:20,640 --> 01:33:22,107
Ours was too crowded.

1132
01:33:22,242 --> 01:33:23,800
Tell me what you heard.

1133
01:33:23,943 --> 01:33:27,106
That she's doing you.

1134
01:33:27,247 --> 01:33:27,906
Says who?

1135
01:33:28,047 --> 01:33:29,605
The literature teacher.

1136
01:33:29,749 --> 01:33:31,011
What else did she say?

1137
01:33:31,851 --> 01:33:33,011
Say it!

1138
01:33:34,354 --> 01:33:39,382
That CHOI got kicked out of school
for sleeping with a married man.

1139
01:33:44,731 --> 01:33:48,394
So you spread the made-up stories?

1140
01:33:49,035 --> 01:33:50,400
Are you nuts?

1141
01:33:52,238 --> 01:33:53,296
Come here.

1142
01:33:53,606 --> 01:33:55,198
Bitches like you don't
have to study.

1143
01:33:55,341 --> 01:33:56,706
Go home.

1144
01:33:56,843 --> 01:33:59,107
You'll be expelled.

1145
01:33:59,245 --> 01:34:01,110
Don't come back to school!

1146
01:34:23,536 --> 01:34:27,199
Can we talk for a second?

1147
01:34:55,635 --> 01:35:00,800
CHOI and I had so much
in common that we...

1148
01:35:00,940 --> 01:35:02,703
You guys sleep together?

1149
01:35:02,842 --> 01:35:04,605
No way!

1150
01:35:04,744 --> 01:35:06,302
Never.

1151
01:35:06,546 --> 01:35:08,514
So that married guy thing is true.

1152
01:35:09,048 --> 01:35:12,415
CHOI was framed.

1153
01:35:12,552 --> 01:35:14,019
Says who?

1154
01:35:14,153 --> 01:35:15,814
CHOI did?

1155
01:35:15,955 --> 01:35:19,482
She told you that herself?

1156
01:35:22,228 --> 01:35:23,388
Look, KIM.

1157
01:35:24,931 --> 01:35:28,992
I don't know why I have to
tell you about my private life.

1158
01:35:30,036 --> 01:35:34,803
I understand you're upset

1159
01:35:34,941 --> 01:35:37,000
because you're Hui-jung's friend.

1160
01:35:37,143 --> 01:35:38,610
Hui-jung and I...

1161
01:35:38,745 --> 01:35:41,111
we have been
together for 6 years now.

1162
01:35:41,247 --> 01:35:44,808
All these years,
it's been more than being good.

1163
01:35:44,951 --> 01:35:47,112
It still is.

1164
01:35:47,954 --> 01:35:52,482
But this means there's no trust.

1165
01:35:53,927 --> 01:35:54,985
It's my fault.

1166
01:35:55,128 --> 01:35:59,997
I must've done something
to make her doubt me.

1167
01:36:03,636 --> 01:36:07,697
But there's nothing
between CHOI and me.

1168
01:36:09,642 --> 01:36:12,611
You know the grapevine is
very well established here.

1169
01:36:12,745 --> 01:36:14,804
You should've been careful.

1170
01:36:15,848 --> 01:36:19,113
You should've dealt with her
in a more professional way.

1171
01:36:21,254 --> 01:36:25,486
It seems like
CHOI has a crush on you.

1172
01:36:25,625 --> 01:36:29,994
No, she has a fiancé.

1173
01:36:30,730 --> 01:36:34,496
I'm sure CHOI is having
a rough time over this.

1174
01:36:41,140 --> 01:36:43,506
I didn't mean for this to happen.

1175
01:36:44,644 --> 01:36:46,612
I was just so upset.

1176
01:36:47,747 --> 01:36:49,612
Hui-jung was crying and...

1177
01:36:50,550 --> 01:36:54,111
I'm really sorry
about this whole thing.

1178
01:37:04,931 --> 01:37:06,091
Hi.

1179
01:37:08,735 --> 01:37:10,396
Coming back from lunch?

1180
01:37:26,352 --> 01:37:27,512
Excuse me.

1181
01:37:31,024 --> 01:37:33,891
Anything happened
between you and LEE?

1182
01:37:37,230 --> 01:37:39,095
You're unbelievable.

1183
01:37:40,433 --> 01:37:43,596
The school is upside-down...
due to you.

1184
01:37:44,437 --> 01:37:45,165
What?

1185
01:37:47,540 --> 01:37:52,307
<i>I understand you liked him</i>
<i>as a man... </i>

1186
01:37:54,047 --> 01:37:58,507
<i>... because he was so nice to you</i>
<i>and all that. </i>

1187
01:37:58,651 --> 01:38:01,017
<i>I don't blame you. </i>

1188
01:38:02,255 --> 01:38:03,984
<i>But you have a fiancé. </i>

1189
01:38:06,726 --> 01:38:08,193
<i>Did LEE tell you that?</i>

1190
01:38:09,429 --> 01:38:11,488
<i>Did he say</i>
<i>that I liked him?</i>

1191
01:38:14,634 --> 01:38:16,499
<i>He denied it, of course. </i>

1192
01:38:17,036 --> 01:38:20,597
<i>He was very worried</i>
<i>and protective about you. </i>

1193
01:38:29,148 --> 01:38:33,414
<i>I heard about the incident</i>
<i>at your old school. </i>

1194
01:39:02,648 --> 01:39:06,311
<i>What did LEE say about me?</i>

1195
01:39:08,955 --> 01:39:11,389
<i>That the rumor wasn't true. </i>

1196
01:39:11,524 --> 01:39:15,790
<i>And that he was only helping you</i>
<i>as your counselor. </i>

1197
01:39:29,041 --> 01:39:29,598
Yu-lim.

1198
01:39:29,742 --> 01:39:33,803
Answer my question honestly.

1199
01:39:34,447 --> 01:39:35,607
Okay.

1200
01:39:36,449 --> 01:39:39,213
Did you tell KIM?

1201
01:39:42,955 --> 01:39:43,979
What?

1202
01:39:44,123 --> 01:39:45,283
What?

1203
01:39:49,428 --> 01:39:50,793
About CHOI.

1204
01:39:50,930 --> 01:39:52,898
CHOI?
That student teacher?

1205
01:39:53,032 --> 01:39:53,999
Yes.

1206
01:39:54,133 --> 01:39:56,499
No, I did not.

1207
01:39:59,438 --> 01:40:01,201
You didn't?

1208
01:40:02,041 --> 01:40:03,406
What about her?

1209
01:40:05,144 --> 01:40:07,704
I just talked to KIM.

1210
01:40:08,347 --> 01:40:12,306
Stop fucking lying to me!
Spill the beans!

1211
01:40:13,252 --> 01:40:15,516
You asked me to check out
that assistant professor.

1212
01:40:16,255 --> 01:40:18,985
It wasn't his fault.
Everybody says so.

1213
01:40:21,527 --> 01:40:22,391
What?

1214
01:40:22,528 --> 01:40:24,496
She's a slut.

1215
01:40:24,630 --> 01:40:27,394
She made advances on him.

1216
01:40:27,833 --> 01:40:32,099
She's a home wrecker,
a total psycho.

1217
01:40:32,238 --> 01:40:34,604
She hit on you too, didn't she?

1218
01:40:43,049 --> 01:40:44,414
Are you okay?

1219
01:40:45,618 --> 01:40:47,677
Why are you doing this to me?

1220
01:40:47,787 --> 01:40:49,049
Why?

1221
01:40:54,427 --> 01:40:55,792
Do you like her?

1222
01:41:06,939 --> 01:41:08,998
Get out of here, asshole!

1223
01:41:09,141 --> 01:41:10,301
Go!

1224
01:41:25,524 --> 01:41:26,991
It's CHOI!

1225
01:41:31,530 --> 01:41:32,997
She's a nutcase.

1226
01:41:34,734 --> 01:41:36,201
She turns me off!

1227
01:41:36,335 --> 01:41:38,303
What a slut!

1228
01:41:42,842 --> 01:41:44,207
I can't believe she's a stalker.

1229
01:41:44,343 --> 01:41:45,708
She's disgusting.

1230
01:41:53,653 --> 01:41:57,680
You should've controlled
your temper.

1231
01:41:58,424 --> 01:42:02,793
We persuaded their parents
not to press charges.

1232
01:42:04,730 --> 01:42:08,496
All you need to do is write
a letter of apology.

1233
01:42:08,734 --> 01:42:09,894
Okay.

1234
01:42:12,138 --> 01:42:15,596
You're kind of old
for a student teacher.

1235
01:42:17,643 --> 01:42:20,703
That story on the net...
Is it true?

1236
01:42:21,547 --> 01:42:23,606
Are you seeing each other?

1237
01:42:24,750 --> 01:42:27,310
No, that's not it.

1238
01:42:27,453 --> 01:42:34,689
It's just that we had good feelings
for each other.

1239
01:42:35,828 --> 01:42:37,796
Also, we're in charge of
same class.

1240
01:42:37,930 --> 01:42:40,592
After all, I'm her counselor.

1241
01:42:40,733 --> 01:42:42,792
So we've become friends.

1242
01:42:43,636 --> 01:42:45,797
And the kids kind of blew it
out of proportion.

1243
01:42:55,448 --> 01:42:58,212
So you are not together?

1244
01:43:01,654 --> 01:43:04,589
Well, it sounds like nothing.
Let's wrap this up.

1245
01:43:14,233 --> 01:43:16,793
You're off the hook now.

1246
01:43:16,936 --> 01:43:19,097
- Bad luck happen sometimes.
- Come on, let's go.

1247
01:43:19,238 --> 01:43:22,298
- It's alright.
- Don't worry about it.

1248
01:43:22,441 --> 01:43:23,806
You'll be fine.

1249
01:43:28,447 --> 01:43:32,110
I have something to tell you.

1250
01:43:34,553 --> 01:43:35,713
The truth is...

1251
01:43:37,123 --> 01:43:40,286
LEE molested me.

1252
01:43:41,827 --> 01:43:46,890
Unlike he said,
I have no feelings for him.

1253
01:43:48,033 --> 01:43:51,696
He used his position
as a counselor to molest me.

1254
01:43:52,037 --> 01:43:54,597
He forced me to drink
with him.

1255
01:43:54,740 --> 01:43:56,207
When I refused it,

1256
01:43:57,643 --> 01:43:59,907
he groped me at work.

1257
01:44:00,846 --> 01:44:03,110
He harassed and threatened me.

1258
01:44:03,249 --> 01:44:04,807
He even came to my place.

1259
01:44:04,950 --> 01:44:08,909
CHOI, what are you talking about?

1260
01:44:09,355 --> 01:44:10,982
You broke the window

1261
01:44:12,925 --> 01:44:15,189
and stole keys from me

1262
01:44:15,327 --> 01:44:17,693
and let yourself into my place.

1263
01:44:17,830 --> 01:44:19,092
Didn't you?

1264
01:44:19,231 --> 01:44:22,598
No, that's not it.

1265
01:44:22,735 --> 01:44:24,896
I have a fiancé.

1266
01:44:25,538 --> 01:44:26,903
And I heard that...

1267
01:44:27,039 --> 01:44:30,907
He said he had a fiancé
and harassed me.

1268
01:44:31,043 --> 01:44:32,601
You call that being nice?

1269
01:44:37,450 --> 01:44:39,315
You used your position

1270
01:44:41,253 --> 01:44:43,585
to molest a woman.

1271
01:44:52,031 --> 01:44:54,192
Let's go have a talk.

1272
01:45:10,549 --> 01:45:13,211
Let's talk outside.

1273
01:45:13,853 --> 01:45:16,981
- Okay, hold on.
- Let's go.

1274
01:45:29,034 --> 01:45:30,296
CHOI!

1275
01:45:30,436 --> 01:45:31,596
CHOI!

1276
01:45:31,837 --> 01:45:32,496
We need to talk.

1277
01:45:32,638 --> 01:45:35,004
- Come on, let's go.
- Give me a second.

1278
01:45:35,140 --> 01:45:36,300
- CHOI!
- You'll be fine.

1279
01:45:37,643 --> 01:45:40,009
CHOI, we need to talk!

1280
01:45:49,555 --> 01:45:52,786
CHOI was molested.
LEE raped her!

1281
01:45:52,925 --> 01:45:55,393
- Really?
- Yeah, It's true.

1282
01:45:55,528 --> 01:45:56,995
The police are here!

1283
01:46:12,244 --> 01:46:13,404
She's coming!

1284
01:46:30,129 --> 01:46:32,188
What a pity!

1285
01:47:12,438 --> 01:47:13,598
Hello?

1286
01:47:13,739 --> 01:47:19,200
<i>CHOI, it's over. </i>
<i>He's been fired. </i>

1287
01:47:19,345 --> 01:47:20,607
What?

1288
01:47:20,746 --> 01:47:22,509
<i>He completely fooled us. </i>

1289
01:47:22,648 --> 01:47:24,411
<i>I can't believe that jerk. </i>

1290
01:47:25,250 --> 01:47:28,811
<i>I don't know how he even</i>
<i>became a teacher. </i>

1291
01:47:28,954 --> 01:47:32,082
<i>You don't have to be ashamed. </i>

1292
01:47:32,224 --> 01:47:33,486
<i>Just think of it as bad luck. </i>

1293
01:47:34,627 --> 01:47:37,994
<i>We're all worried about you. </i>

1294
01:47:38,130 --> 01:47:40,394
<i>You know we're on your side. </i>

1295
01:48:59,511 --> 01:49:00,569
Let's break up.

1296
01:49:04,950 --> 01:49:06,611
Don't do this now.

1297
01:49:09,755 --> 01:49:14,283
I stayed up all night operating.

1298
01:49:17,196 --> 01:49:19,562
There's someone else.

1299
01:49:25,537 --> 01:49:27,095
You slept with him?

1300
01:49:38,650 --> 01:49:40,515
Yes.

1301
01:49:59,638 --> 01:50:01,105
Listen.

1302
01:50:01,640 --> 01:50:06,202
This is very important.
It's on the SAT every year.

1303
01:50:06,345 --> 01:50:10,509
Learn it by heart
by the end of the class.

1304
01:50:12,751 --> 01:50:13,911
Okay?

1305
01:50:28,333 --> 01:50:29,493
It's cold.

1306
01:50:32,137 --> 01:50:34,196
I'm leaving.
Look.

1307
01:50:36,141 --> 01:50:39,201
You smoked in class again?

1308
01:50:40,078 --> 01:50:41,511
What are you talking about?

1309
01:50:42,247 --> 01:50:45,216
I received a complaint again.

1310
01:50:45,350 --> 01:50:46,510
Okay.

1311
01:50:46,652 --> 01:50:52,386
The competition is really fierce.
You can't keep doing this.

1312
01:50:55,627 --> 01:50:56,787
Hello?

1313
01:50:58,831 --> 01:51:00,992
- I'm out of here.
- Wait.

1314
01:51:01,934 --> 01:51:03,094
It's for you.

1315
01:51:07,339 --> 01:51:08,499
Who is it?

1316
01:51:10,742 --> 01:51:11,902
Hello?

1317
01:51:12,644 --> 01:51:13,804
Hello?

1318
01:51:16,048 --> 01:51:17,208
It went dead.

1319
01:51:18,250 --> 01:51:19,410
Who was it?

1320
01:51:19,551 --> 01:51:20,711
It was a girl.

1321
01:51:21,453 --> 01:51:22,613
A girl?

1322
01:51:47,446 --> 01:51:48,606
Yeah.

1323
01:51:51,149 --> 01:51:52,514
Hi.

1324
01:51:52,651 --> 01:51:54,209
Hi.

1325
01:51:54,853 --> 01:51:56,013
What are you doing here?

1326
01:51:58,824 --> 01:52:03,386
I work for a friend of mine.

1327
01:52:04,129 --> 01:52:06,495
He opened a private institute.

1328
01:52:12,938 --> 01:52:14,496
What are you doing here?

1329
01:52:15,240 --> 01:52:17,003
I'm going somewhere.

1330
01:52:17,542 --> 01:52:18,702
I see.

1331
01:52:25,550 --> 01:52:27,415
You got a perm?

1332
01:52:28,854 --> 01:52:29,980
Yeah...

1333
01:52:32,424 --> 01:52:33,584
Bitch!

1334
01:52:35,928 --> 01:52:37,987
You're a bitch.

1335
01:52:39,131 --> 01:52:40,598
A bitch like you...

1336
01:52:44,036 --> 01:52:47,494
I can kill you right now.

1337
01:52:50,142 --> 01:52:52,007
But I'm not dirtying my hands.

1338
01:52:54,246 --> 01:52:58,512
All I did was like you.

1339
01:52:59,952 --> 01:53:02,011
And this is what I get?

1340
01:53:05,257 --> 01:53:06,918
What'd I do wrong?

1341
01:53:08,026 --> 01:53:10,995
What did I do for you
to mess my life up?

1342
01:53:17,836 --> 01:53:19,599
I liked you too.

1343
01:53:19,738 --> 01:53:23,003
Fuck you!
You can't fool me.

1344
01:53:24,242 --> 01:53:25,800
You call yourself a human?

1345
01:53:29,448 --> 01:53:32,542
How could you do that
to someone that you liked?

1346
01:53:40,025 --> 01:53:41,390
Wanna sleep with me?

1347
01:53:42,728 --> 01:53:43,888
Crazy bitch!

1348
01:53:44,429 --> 01:53:45,589
Are you nuts?

1349
01:53:48,834 --> 01:53:52,292
I wanna sleep with you.

1350
01:53:55,140 --> 01:53:59,702
Let me tell you.
You can't fool me again.

1351
01:54:01,113 --> 01:54:04,276
After what happened,

1352
01:54:05,250 --> 01:54:07,115
I'm too frightened to date.

1353
01:54:09,554 --> 01:54:11,579
It's all your fault!

1354
01:54:16,128 --> 01:54:18,688
So I'll take the responsibility.

1355
01:54:20,232 --> 01:54:23,292
Don't even think
about toying with me.

1356
01:54:24,136 --> 01:54:25,296
After tonight,

1357
01:54:26,438 --> 01:54:28,201
I don't wanna see you again.

1358
01:54:29,941 --> 01:54:32,603
If you see me on the street,
don't even say hi.

1359
01:54:34,446 --> 01:54:36,505
If you do, I'll kill you.

1360
01:54:50,829 --> 01:54:52,194
Crazy bitch!

1361
01:54:53,031 --> 01:54:54,293
You're gonna get it!

1362
01:55:04,843 --> 01:55:08,506
I sleep well now.

1363
01:55:10,949 --> 01:55:12,211
Even without you...

1364
01:55:13,952 --> 01:55:16,420
After a few years of insomnia.

1365
01:55:19,024 --> 01:55:20,184
Good for you.

1366
01:55:21,693 --> 01:55:23,786
You don't need me now.

1367
01:55:25,030 --> 01:55:26,588
Let go of my arm.

1368
01:55:27,732 --> 01:55:29,290
You sleep well, right?

1369
01:55:30,335 --> 01:55:32,098
Let go.

1370
01:55:34,940 --> 01:55:38,205
So I thank you.

1371
01:55:47,853 --> 01:55:50,788
You're laughing?

1372
01:56:04,236 --> 01:56:05,396
You're up.

1373
01:56:06,004 --> 01:56:08,871
What happened?

1374
01:56:09,641 --> 01:56:11,700
You passed out last night.

1375
01:56:12,511 --> 01:56:15,480
It was so hard to drag you here.

1376
01:56:17,782 --> 01:56:20,250
Damn, I remember nothing.

1377
01:56:25,524 --> 01:56:26,684
I don't know.

1378
01:56:38,336 --> 01:56:39,894
Move your arm.

1379
01:56:41,439 --> 01:56:43,407
It's stifling.

1380
01:56:48,446 --> 01:56:49,606
It snowed!

1381
01:56:50,749 --> 01:56:51,909
The first snow of the year!

1382
01:56:58,123 --> 01:57:00,284
We're the first to step on it.

1383
01:57:02,127 --> 01:57:03,492
It's so pretty!

1384
01:57:15,840 --> 01:57:17,808
Gosh!

1385
01:57:17,943 --> 01:57:19,205
Are you okay?

1386
01:57:21,646 --> 01:57:23,204
My legs are shaky.

1387
01:57:25,850 --> 01:57:28,717
- How embarrassing.
- Why'd you fall?

1388
01:57:29,654 --> 01:57:30,985
It's slippery.

1389
01:57:32,924 --> 01:57:34,391
I don't feel very good.

1390
01:57:36,828 --> 01:57:38,591
I should stop drinking.

1391
01:57:38,830 --> 01:57:40,798
Why'd you drink so much?

1392
01:57:40,932 --> 01:57:44,698
You don't know?
Because of what you've done to me!

1393
01:57:45,537 --> 01:57:46,697
I feel burn in my stomach.
