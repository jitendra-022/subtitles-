1
00:00:00,899 --> 00:00:01,835
Hello, friend.

2
00:00:02,551 --> 00:00:03,841
Hello, friend?

3
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:05,243
That's lame.

4
00:00:05,244 --> 00:00:07,439
Maybe I should give you a name,

5
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:09,111
but that's a slippery slope.

6
00:00:09,112 --> 00:00:10,023
You're only in my head.

7
00:00:10,024 --> 00:00:11,947
We have to remember that.

8
00:00:12,471 --> 00:00:13,728
Shit.

9
00:00:13,799 --> 00:00:14,610
It's actually happened,

10
00:00:14,611 --> 00:00:16,722
I'm talking to an imaginary person.

11
00:00:18,399 --> 00:00:19,600
What I'm about to tell you

12
00:00:19,601 --> 00:00:20,939
is top secret,

13
00:00:21,099 --> 00:00:24,038
a conspiracy bigger than all of us.

14
00:00:24,599 --> 00:00:26,562
There's a powerful
group of people out there

15
00:00:26,563 --> 00:00:28,602
that are secretly running the world.

16
00:00:30,299 --> 00:00:32,234
I'm talking about the
guys no one knows about,

17
00:00:32,235 --> 00:00:34,082
the guys that are invisible.

18
00:00:35,199 --> 00:00:38,419
The top 1% of the top
1%, the guys that play God

19
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:40,236
without permission.

20
00:00:42,499 --> 00:00:44,447
And now I think they're following me.

21
00:00:53,699 --> 00:00:55,491
This is about last night.

22
00:00:55,492 --> 00:00:58,048
I should've gone to
Angela's birthday party.

23
00:00:58,499 --> 00:01:00,699
Instead, I went to...

24
00:01:13,299 --> 00:01:14,049
Hey, Ron.

25
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:15,503
There you go.

26
00:01:51,699 --> 00:01:53,699
You're Ron.

27
00:01:57,618 --> 00:02:00,936
But your real name is Rohit Mehta.

28
00:02:00,937 --> 00:02:02,719
You changed it to Ron when you bought

29
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:04,224
your first Ron's Coffee Shop

30
00:02:04,225 --> 00:02:05,906
six years ago.

31
00:02:05,999 --> 00:02:09,745
Now you got 17 of 'em with
8 more coming next quarter.

32
00:02:12,763 --> 00:02:14,566
May I help you with something?

33
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:18,002
I like coming here 'cause
your Wi-Fi was fast.

34
00:02:18,003 --> 00:02:19,141
I mean, you're one of the few spots

35
00:02:19,142 --> 00:02:21,911
that has a fiber connection
with gigabit speed.

36
00:02:21,912 --> 00:02:23,213
It's good.

37
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:27,177
So good, it scratched
that part of my mind, part

38
00:02:27,178 --> 00:02:30,938
that doesn't allow good
to exist without condition,

39
00:02:30,939 --> 00:02:33,602
so I started intercepting all the traffic

40
00:02:33,603 --> 00:02:34,872
on your network.

41
00:02:34,899 --> 00:02:37,160
That's when I noticed something strange.

42
00:02:38,212 --> 00:02:40,915
It's when I decided to hack you.

43
00:02:41,899 --> 00:02:43,683
- Hack...
- I know you run a website

44
00:02:43,684 --> 00:02:46,213
- called Plato's Boys.
- Pardon me?

45
00:02:46,214 --> 00:02:48,899
You're using Tor networking
to keep the servers anonymous.

46
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:49,950
You made it really hard

47
00:02:49,951 --> 00:02:52,708
for anyone to see it, but I saw it.

48
00:02:53,181 --> 00:02:54,617
The onion routing protocol,

49
00:02:54,618 --> 00:02:56,899
it's not as anonymous as you think it is.

50
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:58,899
Whoever's in control of the exit nodes

51
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:00,899
is also in control of the traffic,

52
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:02,677
which makes me...

53
00:03:03,344 --> 00:03:04,899
the one in control.

54
00:03:06,899 --> 00:03:08,899
I must ask you to kindly leave.

55
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:11,834
I own everything. All your emails.

56
00:03:11,835 --> 00:03:13,398
All your files.

57
00:03:13,399 --> 00:03:14,899
All your... pics.

58
00:03:18,099 --> 00:03:20,240
Get out of here right now,

59
00:03:20,241 --> 00:03:22,054
- or I'll call the...
- Police?

60
00:03:22,055 --> 00:03:23,098
You want them to find out

61
00:03:23,099 --> 00:03:25,339
about the 100 terabytes
of child pornography

62
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:27,691
you serve to your 400,000 users?

63
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:31,017
Personally, man, I was

64
00:03:31,018 --> 00:03:32,700
hoping it was just gonna be

65
00:03:32,701 --> 00:03:34,524
some BDSM stuff.

66
00:03:35,013 --> 00:03:37,787
You realize how much
simpler that would have been?

67
00:03:42,199 --> 00:03:45,199
I did not hurt anyone.

68
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,199
I never did.

69
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:54,034
That's my...

70
00:03:54,035 --> 00:03:55,597
personal life.

71
00:03:59,699 --> 00:04:02,779
I understand what it's like

72
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:04,829
to be different.

73
00:04:06,699 --> 00:04:09,607
I'm very different too.

74
00:04:11,299 --> 00:04:14,412
I mean, I don't jerk off
to little kids, but...

75
00:04:16,099 --> 00:04:18,150
I don't know how to talk to people.

76
00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:21,799
My dad was the only one I could talk to.

77
00:04:24,499 --> 00:04:26,499
But he died.

78
00:04:31,499 --> 00:04:33,360
I'm sorry to hear that.

79
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:39,138
- How did he pass, may I ask?
- Leukemia.

80
00:04:40,399 --> 00:04:43,985
He definitely got it from
radiation at the company

81
00:04:43,986 --> 00:04:46,233
he worked at, though I couldn't prove it.

82
00:04:47,399 --> 00:04:48,659
Now he's dead.

83
00:04:49,999 --> 00:04:52,000
Company's fine, though.

84
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:57,870
Oh... hey.

85
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:01,799
It's okay, Rohit.

86
00:05:02,799 --> 00:05:05,067
You don't have to worry anymore.

87
00:05:06,999 --> 00:05:08,999
I don't understand.

88
00:05:09,899 --> 00:05:11,900
Are you blackmailing me?

89
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:15,678
So that's what this is about...

90
00:05:15,679 --> 00:05:17,600
money.

91
00:05:17,601 --> 00:05:20,737
That's all you care about, huh?

92
00:05:21,399 --> 00:05:23,399
No.

93
00:05:24,799 --> 00:05:26,266
If I pay you now,

94
00:05:26,267 --> 00:05:28,173
you'll want more and more.

95
00:05:28,174 --> 00:05:30,426
No matter how much I give.

96
00:05:32,268 --> 00:05:34,799
You will inform the police anyway.

97
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,799
I won't pay you, sir.

98
00:05:38,799 --> 00:05:41,139
Remember, you also broke the law.

99
00:05:43,099 --> 00:05:45,099
Actually, you're right.

100
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:46,909
Partly.

101
00:05:47,816 --> 00:05:50,682
See, I usually do this kind
of thing from my computer,

102
00:05:50,683 --> 00:05:52,878
but this time I wanted to do it AFK.

103
00:05:53,799 --> 00:05:55,799
In person.

104
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:58,061
Trying to work on my social anxiety.

105
00:05:58,599 --> 00:06:00,434
But there's always the
threat of you fleeing

106
00:06:00,435 --> 00:06:01,810
after I call you out.

107
00:06:01,811 --> 00:06:05,045
You'd tell your sys admin
to take your servers down,

108
00:06:05,046 --> 00:06:06,346
wipe all the data.

109
00:06:06,347 --> 00:06:09,838
So I made sure to include the current time

110
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:13,088
and... and location on my anonymous tip.

111
00:06:13,089 --> 00:06:14,795
Wait. Hold on. I'll give you the money.

112
00:06:14,796 --> 00:06:15,848
I'll pay you.

113
00:06:15,849 --> 00:06:17,709
How much do you want? I'll pay you.

114
00:06:18,768 --> 00:06:21,255
That's the part you
were wrong about, Rohit.

115
00:06:21,779 --> 00:06:24,543
I don't give a shit about money.

116
00:06:36,834 --> 00:06:38,830
Now I'm being followed.

117
00:06:45,161 --> 00:06:47,168
The higher ups don't like
someone with my powers.

118
00:06:47,169 --> 00:06:49,862
In three short minutes, I
destroyed a man's business,

119
00:06:49,863 --> 00:06:51,337
life, existence.

120
00:06:51,685 --> 00:06:53,692
- I deleted him.
- Hey!

121
00:06:54,723 --> 00:06:57,367
Hey, you. Hey, kiddo.

122
00:06:58,606 --> 00:07:00,613
What's happening?

123
00:07:05,704 --> 00:07:08,083
Exciting time in the world right now.

124
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:12,051
Exciting time.

125
00:07:33,412 --> 00:07:35,621
But I'm only a vigilante hacker by night.

126
00:07:35,622 --> 00:07:38,626
By day, just a regular
cyber security engineer,

127
00:07:39,345 --> 00:07:43,232
employee number ER28-0652.

128
00:07:45,068 --> 00:07:46,072
Elliot!

129
00:07:46,073 --> 00:07:49,081
In here.

130
00:07:52,092 --> 00:07:54,099
- What's up?
- El.

131
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:02,672
All over the price...
Yeah, I can totally...

132
00:08:02,673 --> 00:08:03,979
I can totally handle it.

133
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:05,986
They were hacked again last night.

134
00:08:07,143 --> 00:08:08,015
Gideon...

135
00:08:08,016 --> 00:08:09,711
That's my childhood friend Angela.

136
00:08:09,712 --> 00:08:11,734
She can be a bit high strung sometimes,

137
00:08:11,735 --> 00:08:13,849
but trust me... she's one of the good ones.

138
00:08:14,167 --> 00:08:14,976
What am I looking at?

139
00:08:14,977 --> 00:08:17,508
Is this the log file?
This was a RUDY attack.

140
00:08:18,181 --> 00:08:19,185
This is awesome.

141
00:08:19,186 --> 00:08:20,711
- Gideon, will you answer me?
- Awesome?

142
00:08:20,712 --> 00:08:23,198
You think this is awesome?
This is killing us, Elliot.

143
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:25,717
- Gideon, I'm not...
- Angela!

144
00:08:25,718 --> 00:08:28,215
Let's just see how this meeting goes today.

145
00:08:28,216 --> 00:08:30,818
Their networks are getting
attacked every week.

146
00:08:30,819 --> 00:08:33,233
Who knows if they'll
still even be a client.

147
00:08:34,448 --> 00:08:36,532
- They're coming in?
- Hey, what did we say

148
00:08:36,533 --> 00:08:39,763
about the dress code?

149
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:42,232
All right, now, look over those logs.

150
00:08:42,233 --> 00:08:44,810
And be ready this afternoon in
case they have any questions.

151
00:08:44,811 --> 00:08:48,085
- Okay?
- Okay.

152
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:53,863
- Start smoking again?
- Did you not get my texts last night?

153
00:08:53,864 --> 00:08:56,223
I sent you exactly 13 of them.

154
00:08:56,224 --> 00:08:58,348
Yeah, I'm sorry. I couldn't make it.

155
00:09:01,329 --> 00:09:04,087
You promised me that you
were gonna try this time.

156
00:09:18,991 --> 00:09:19,994
Stop thinking about something else

157
00:09:19,995 --> 00:09:22,001
when I'm talking to you.

158
00:09:22,701 --> 00:09:24,254
I hate when you do that.

159
00:09:24,255 --> 00:09:27,464
Sorry. I was thinking about work.

160
00:09:27,799 --> 00:09:29,799
Maybe that's why Gideon loves you so much.

161
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,799
He thanks me all the
time for bringing you in.

162
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:35,011
But for some reason, I think
you secretly hate it here.

163
00:09:35,799 --> 00:09:37,799
She was right. I liked most of the people,

164
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,690
but our business, a cyber security firm

165
00:09:39,691 --> 00:09:43,434
that protects corporations... I
can't think of anything I hate more.

166
00:09:43,435 --> 00:09:47,283
No, I love it here.

167
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:55,263
I'm sorry. I'm just in a bad mood.

168
00:09:56,599 --> 00:09:59,055
I'm late on my last two
student loan payments,

169
00:09:59,056 --> 00:10:01,799
and I can't get Gideon to give me a raise.

170
00:10:02,499 --> 00:10:04,499
- Hey...
- Hi.

171
00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:07,661
Yo, buddy. Missed you last night.

172
00:10:07,662 --> 00:10:09,807
- Where were you?
- Gotta go. Big meeting today.

173
00:10:13,299 --> 00:10:15,878
- Did you find out what happened?
- Yeah.

174
00:10:15,879 --> 00:10:17,536
He said he was working.

175
00:10:17,537 --> 00:10:18,836
Oh, come on. You gotta talk to him.

176
00:10:18,837 --> 00:10:20,122
We're gonna be late for the staff meeting.

177
00:10:20,123 --> 00:10:23,074
He can't stand me. And you know why.

178
00:10:23,075 --> 00:10:27,389
Angela, I can't have that
kind of negativity in my life.

179
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:31,799
That's exactly what I'm talking about.

180
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,799
What are you thinking about?

181
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:46,799
Nothing.

182
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,799
You want to know what I'm thinking about?

183
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:54,799
First time you came to me.

184
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,366
I didn't exactly come to Krista.

185
00:10:56,367 --> 00:10:58,799
I was forced here. But I do like her.

186
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:02,348
Hacking her was simple.
Her password: Dylan 2791.

187
00:11:02,349 --> 00:11:05,639
Favorite artist and the year in
which she was born, backwards.

188
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:07,610
Though she's a psychologist,

189
00:11:07,611 --> 00:11:09,345
she's really bad at reading people.

190
00:11:09,346 --> 00:11:11,399
But I'm good at reading people.

191
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:14,933
My secret: I look for the worst in them.

192
00:11:15,699 --> 00:11:17,699
I know she went through
a divorce four years ago.

193
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:18,699
I know she was devastated by it

194
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:21,699
and has been dating losers
on eHarmony ever since.

195
00:11:24,999 --> 00:11:27,999
Her most recent foray... Michael Hansen.

196
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,113
I searched for him online,
but nothing came up.

197
00:11:31,114 --> 00:11:33,403
No LinkedIn, no Facebook, nothing.

198
00:11:33,404 --> 00:11:35,202
Something about him bugs me,

199
00:11:35,203 --> 00:11:36,845
scratching that part of my mind again.

200
00:11:36,846 --> 00:11:39,364
But I'll hack him soon enough. I always do.

201
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:41,400
I know you're not yelling like before,

202
00:11:41,401 --> 00:11:42,699
which is good.

203
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:45,899
But I can tell you're
still holding on to it.

204
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:48,470
And we need to work on
your anger issues, Elliot.

205
00:11:48,471 --> 00:11:51,199
You're angry at everyone, at society...

206
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,161
Fuck society.

207
00:11:52,562 --> 00:11:54,299
I know you have a lot to be angry about,

208
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:57,058
but keeping it to yourself and
staying quiet like you're doing...

209
00:11:57,108 --> 00:11:59,807
it's not going to help you.

210
00:12:00,401 --> 00:12:03,882
There's pain underneath. That's
where our work needs to go.

211
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:11,855
What is it about society
that disappoints you so much?

212
00:12:18,255 --> 00:12:20,608
Oh, I don't know.

213
00:12:20,609 --> 00:12:23,481
Is it that we collectively
thought Steve Jobs

214
00:12:23,482 --> 00:12:25,432
was a great man, even when we knew

215
00:12:25,433 --> 00:12:29,850
he made billions off the backs of children?

216
00:12:29,851 --> 00:12:34,027
Or maybe it's that it feels like
all our heroes are counterfeit.

217
00:12:34,272 --> 00:12:37,387
The world itself's just one big hoax.

218
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:41,443
Spamming with our running
commentary of bullshit

219
00:12:41,444 --> 00:12:46,421
masquerading as insight, our
social media faking as intimacy.

220
00:12:48,108 --> 00:12:51,110
Or is it that we voted for this?

221
00:12:51,111 --> 00:12:53,345
Not with our rigged
elections, but with our things,

222
00:12:53,346 --> 00:12:55,517
our property, our money.

223
00:12:55,518 --> 00:12:58,234
I'm not saying anything new.
We all know why we do this,

224
00:12:58,235 --> 00:13:00,791
not because Hunger Games
books makes us happy

225
00:13:01,176 --> 00:13:03,342
but because we wanna be sedated.

226
00:13:03,343 --> 00:13:05,352
Because it's painful not to pretend,

227
00:13:05,353 --> 00:13:08,666
because we're cowards.

228
00:13:08,667 --> 00:13:11,642
Fuck society.

229
00:13:11,643 --> 00:13:14,733
Elliot. You're not saying anything.

230
00:13:16,059 --> 00:13:19,103
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

231
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,710
Don't be frustrated.

232
00:13:26,127 --> 00:13:30,590
- Why shouldn't I be?
- You're different than most.

233
00:13:32,417 --> 00:13:34,509
You at least try.

234
00:13:35,263 --> 00:13:37,729
You at least understand.

235
00:13:38,133 --> 00:13:43,614
- Understand what?
- What it's like to feel alone.

236
00:13:45,596 --> 00:13:47,621
You understand the pain.

237
00:13:48,121 --> 00:13:51,159
You want to protect people from it.

238
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:54,097
You want to protect me from it.

239
00:13:55,623 --> 00:13:58,247
I respect that about you.

240
00:14:02,932 --> 00:14:03,924
Why do you think I know

241
00:14:03,925 --> 00:14:07,918
- what it's like to feel alone?
- Shit! From her emails!

242
00:14:07,919 --> 00:14:11,094
- Elliot?
- I don't know.

243
00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:16,454
Let's talk about last night.

244
00:14:16,455 --> 00:14:20,389
Did you go to Angela's birthday party?

245
00:14:24,710 --> 00:14:26,651
Yeah. It was nice.

246
00:14:26,652 --> 00:14:30,738
- Did you try to talk to anyone?
- Sure.

247
00:14:31,234 --> 00:14:33,298
I got a girl's number.

248
00:14:33,299 --> 00:14:35,362
You did?

249
00:14:35,363 --> 00:14:37,426
She's cute.

250
00:14:37,427 --> 00:14:40,522
She likes The Hunger Games.

251
00:14:43,118 --> 00:14:46,896
You're hiding again, Elliot.

252
00:14:48,278 --> 00:14:51,610
When you hide, your delusions come back.

253
00:14:51,611 --> 00:14:54,486
It's a slippery slope.

254
00:14:56,666 --> 00:14:59,585
Let's talk about the men
in black you've been seeing.

255
00:14:59,586 --> 00:15:04,784
- Are they still there?
- No,

256
00:15:05,238 --> 00:15:07,464
I... told you they're gone.

257
00:15:07,465 --> 00:15:10,799
The meds you gave me are working.

258
00:15:16,285 --> 00:15:17,303
Yo, man.

259
00:15:17,304 --> 00:15:19,303
Do you wanna, uh...

260
00:15:19,304 --> 00:15:22,301
- you wanna do lunch today?
- Uh, yeah...

261
00:15:22,302 --> 00:15:24,345
- I got other plans.
- Other plans. Right.

262
00:15:24,346 --> 00:15:28,499
That's... what you said the
last three times I asked you.

263
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:31,494
Look, bud, you... and Angela

264
00:15:31,495 --> 00:15:33,491
have been close for a long time,

265
00:15:33,492 --> 00:15:36,486
and that's even more
reason why I want us to be

266
00:15:36,487 --> 00:15:38,483
on good terms.

267
00:15:38,484 --> 00:15:42,141
I... I just... I feel like things
have been awkward between us.

268
00:15:42,142 --> 00:15:44,666
- Don't you?
- I'm okay

269
00:15:44,667 --> 00:15:47,482
with it being awkward between us.

270
00:15:47,483 --> 00:15:51,764
Um, yeah. I... I'm...
I'm not okay with that.

271
00:15:52,563 --> 00:15:56,620
Um... look, man, I love
Angela, and I want us to...

272
00:15:56,621 --> 00:15:59,582
to get along for her sake.
I mean, that's what I'm...

273
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:02,545
that's what I'm here for. I just, I...

274
00:16:02,546 --> 00:16:06,049
- I don't normally do stuff...
- Am I crazy not to like this guy?

275
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:08,086
Among some of his Facebook likes

276
00:16:08,087 --> 00:16:10,067
are George W. Bush's Decision Points,

277
00:16:10,068 --> 00:16:12,047
Transformers 2: Revenge of the Fallen,

278
00:16:12,048 --> 00:16:15,018
and the music of Josh Groban.

279
00:16:15,019 --> 00:16:17,677
Must I really justify myself any further?

280
00:16:17,678 --> 00:16:19,498
I'm working on that shit, you know?

281
00:16:20,461 --> 00:16:24,189
His was the easiest to hack.
Password was 123456Seven.

282
00:16:25,789 --> 00:16:29,088
I witnessed his first "I love
you" with Angela over Gchat,

283
00:16:29,089 --> 00:16:33,550
then I witnessed the first of
many infidelities with Stella B.

284
00:16:35,102 --> 00:16:36,485
I've never done anything
like this before...

285
00:16:36,486 --> 00:16:37,803
I've thought about telling Angela,

286
00:16:37,804 --> 00:16:40,380
but she has shitty taste in
men, and I'm not quite ready

287
00:16:40,381 --> 00:16:42,304
to see what comes after this just yet.

288
00:16:42,305 --> 00:16:43,436
You like music. I like music.

289
00:16:43,437 --> 00:16:45,465
Maroon 5.

290
00:16:45,466 --> 00:16:48,144
Plus I can manage Ollie
easier than the others.

291
00:16:48,145 --> 00:16:49,538
for now, anyway.

292
00:16:49,539 --> 00:16:50,523
And that's all I mean.

293
00:16:50,524 --> 00:16:52,552
I just want you to know that.

294
00:16:52,953 --> 00:16:54,982
I like you, bro, and...

295
00:16:54,983 --> 00:16:57,012
I want you to like me too.

296
00:16:57,930 --> 00:17:00,056
I understand.

297
00:17:00,057 --> 00:17:01,795
I'll try harder.

298
00:17:01,796 --> 00:17:03,749
That's cool, man.

299
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:06,906
Hey, whenever you're
ready, I'd love to just...

300
00:17:08,175 --> 00:17:09,915
chill.

301
00:17:12,995 --> 00:17:14,382
Oh... forgot about your...

302
00:17:14,383 --> 00:17:16,365
no touching thing.

303
00:17:19,429 --> 00:17:22,621
Truth is, I shouldn't hate
Ollie; he's not that bad a guy.

304
00:17:22,622 --> 00:17:24,666
He's too dumb to be bad.

305
00:17:25,644 --> 00:17:29,232
In fact, when I think about
the really bad people...

306
00:17:31,312 --> 00:17:35,093
E Corp, the largest
conglomerate in the world...

307
00:17:35,094 --> 00:17:38,857
they're so big, they're
literally everywhere.

308
00:17:39,258 --> 00:17:42,079
A perfect monster of modern society.

309
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:44,901
The E might as well stand for Evil.

310
00:17:45,499 --> 00:17:48,506
- And all of life's necessities...
- In fact, after a thorough,

311
00:17:48,507 --> 00:17:51,035
intensive self-reprogramming,
that's all my mind hears,

312
00:17:51,036 --> 00:17:53,142
sees, or reads when
they pop up in my world.

313
00:17:53,143 --> 00:17:54,546
That was have to offer.

314
00:17:54,547 --> 00:17:57,499
Together, we can change
the world, with E...

315
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:59,499
Evil Corp.

316
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:02,031
Krista would have a shit
fit if she knew I did that.

317
00:18:02,032 --> 00:18:05,771
But that's what they are...
a conglomerate of evil.

318
00:18:06,099 --> 00:18:09,070
- And now I have to help them.
- There are six on-site engineers

319
00:18:09,071 --> 00:18:10,310
on your account.

320
00:18:10,311 --> 00:18:13,646
- Plus a few off-site...
- There he is, Terry Colby, the CTO.

321
00:18:14,299 --> 00:18:15,989
Even though he's the head technology guy

322
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:19,386
at one of the biggest companies
in the world, he owns a Blackberry.

323
00:18:20,795 --> 00:18:22,296
So this is it right here.

324
00:18:22,297 --> 00:18:25,017
But also looks like he doesn't
see a terminal very often

325
00:18:25,018 --> 00:18:27,351
He's not a techie. He's a moron.

326
00:18:28,439 --> 00:18:31,924
An arrogant moron. The worst kind.

327
00:18:37,502 --> 00:18:40,137
Oh, hi. Tyrell Wellick.

328
00:18:40,138 --> 00:18:42,534
I'm Senior Vice President, Technology.

329
00:18:43,602 --> 00:18:48,427
- Elliot. Just a tech.
- Don't be so humble.

330
00:18:48,428 --> 00:18:51,314
You know, I started out
exactly where you are,

331
00:18:51,315 --> 00:18:54,359
and... to be honest, you
know, my heart is still there.

332
00:18:55,077 --> 00:18:57,884
So I see you're running Gnome.

333
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:01,228
You know, I'm actually on KDE myself.

334
00:19:01,229 --> 00:19:04,335
I know this desktop environment
is supposed to be better but...

335
00:19:04,932 --> 00:19:06,324
you know what they say.

336
00:19:06,325 --> 00:19:10,437
- Old habits... they die hard.
- An executive running Linux with...

337
00:19:10,438 --> 00:19:12,109
Yeah, I know what you're thinking.

338
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:14,198
I'm an executive. I mean...

339
00:19:14,199 --> 00:19:16,193
why am I even running Linux?

340
00:19:16,906 --> 00:19:19,199
Again... old habits.

341
00:19:21,899 --> 00:19:24,459
It's gonna be fun working with you.

342
00:19:24,999 --> 00:19:27,999
I should join the rest of the group.

343
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,999
Bonsoir, Elliot.

344
00:19:36,699 --> 00:19:39,699
Sometimes I dream of saving the world.

345
00:19:42,999 --> 00:19:46,222
Saving everyone from the invisible hand,

346
00:19:46,223 --> 00:19:48,999
one that brands us with an employee badge.

347
00:19:51,999 --> 00:19:55,035
The one that forces us to work for them...

348
00:19:56,272 --> 00:19:59,921
The one that controls us every
day without us knowing it.

349
00:20:01,550 --> 00:20:03,999
But I can't stop it.

350
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,999
I'm not that special.

351
00:20:07,999 --> 00:20:09,999
I'm just anonymous.

352
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,999
I'm just alone.

353
00:20:15,566 --> 00:20:17,788
If it weren't for Qwerty,

354
00:20:17,789 --> 00:20:19,999
I'd be completely empty.

355
00:20:25,999 --> 00:20:29,252
I hate when I can't hold in my loneliness.

356
00:20:31,137 --> 00:20:32,734
This crying has been happening too often,

357
00:20:32,735 --> 00:20:34,827
every other week now.

358
00:20:38,699 --> 00:20:41,699
What do normal people do
when they get this sad?

359
00:20:43,999 --> 00:20:45,999
They reach out to friends
or family, I think.

360
00:20:49,999 --> 00:20:51,999
That's not an option.

361
00:20:54,999 --> 00:20:57,999
I do morphine.

362
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,844
The key to doing morphine
without turning into a junkie

363
00:21:00,845 --> 00:21:03,725
is to limit yourself
to 30 milligrams a day.

364
00:21:03,726 --> 00:21:04,973
Anything more

365
00:21:04,974 --> 00:21:07,899
just builds up your tolerance.

366
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:10,999
I check every pill I get for purity.

367
00:21:11,689 --> 00:21:13,999
I have 8 milligram Suboxone for maintenance

368
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,999
in case I go through withdrawals.

369
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,999
Shit! I'm out again.

370
00:21:22,374 --> 00:21:26,293
- How much?
- On the house.

371
00:21:26,594 --> 00:21:29,699
No, Shayla. Not doing that.

372
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:32,299
Okay? This is just a regular drug deal

373
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:34,299
- like it always is.
- Fine.

374
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,034
So what are you you to tonight?

375
00:21:36,035 --> 00:21:37,999
'Cause I tried to post
something on your Facebook

376
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,659
and couldn't find you.

377
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:41,527
I'm not on Facebook.

378
00:21:41,528 --> 00:21:45,139
- What? Why not?
- 'Cause I hate Facebook.

379
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,999
That's crazy.

380
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:54,679
Well... you want to do these together then?

381
00:21:55,102 --> 00:21:57,700
Pure Molly...

382
00:22:10,699 --> 00:22:13,330
Don't ever make decisions
when you're on morphine.

383
00:22:24,399 --> 00:22:27,399
Instagram check-in for
Krista at Pierre Loti.

384
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:29,013
Okay, Michael Hansen.

385
00:22:29,014 --> 00:22:31,457
Time to find out who you really are.

386
00:23:19,399 --> 00:23:21,399
- Thank you. Bye.
- Bye.

387
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:26,299
Taxi!

388
00:23:30,299 --> 00:23:35,299
Uh, hi... I just left my
keys in one of your cabs.

389
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:37,299
56Y2.

390
00:23:38,599 --> 00:23:39,599
Sure.

391
00:23:42,699 --> 00:23:44,699
What about you two? Huh?

392
00:23:45,299 --> 00:23:47,299
You guys got any spare change?

393
00:23:47,899 --> 00:23:49,698
Help me out?

394
00:23:49,699 --> 00:23:51,899
New York's expensive, guys. Come on.

395
00:23:53,235 --> 00:23:55,999
306 Hawthorne. Thank you. Thank you.

396
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:20,500
Come on, asshole. Piss already.

397
00:24:20,501 --> 00:24:22,080
Come on!

398
00:24:22,081 --> 00:24:23,699
Come on! Will you... will you go?

399
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:24,925
- Come on, go, go!
- Hey!

400
00:24:25,226 --> 00:24:26,513
Go, will ya?

401
00:24:26,514 --> 00:24:28,000
Hey.

402
00:24:31,718 --> 00:24:32,999
May I borrow your phone?

403
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,999
Mine's dead. I need to call my mom.

404
00:24:42,399 --> 00:24:44,399
Thank you.

405
00:25:04,499 --> 00:25:06,499
No answer. Thanks anyway.

406
00:25:23,671 --> 00:25:27,873
- Angela, is everything okay?
- I need you to come to AllSafe.

407
00:25:28,499 --> 00:25:30,173
You're there? It's 3:00 in the morning.

408
00:25:30,174 --> 00:25:33,259
They attacked Evil Corp servers
again, but it's bad this time.

409
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:34,100
It's a DDoS attack.

410
00:25:35,099 --> 00:25:37,877
- Did you call Lloyd? He's on call.
- Yeah, he's here.

411
00:25:38,596 --> 00:25:42,684
- Is he talking to their tech department?
- He's online with them, but so far nothing.

412
00:25:44,399 --> 00:25:47,131
I don't think that Lloyd can handle this.

413
00:25:48,199 --> 00:25:49,902
Look, Gideon just put me on this account.

414
00:25:49,903 --> 00:25:51,572
I can't screw up in my first week.

415
00:25:51,573 --> 00:25:54,199
I need you. Please.

416
00:25:55,699 --> 00:25:57,441
I'll be right there.

417
00:26:08,299 --> 00:26:11,207
- Finally!
- Calm down... it's only been an hour.

418
00:26:11,208 --> 00:26:16,026
Yeah, well, an hour in Evil Corp time is
like $13 million in revenue, approximately.

419
00:26:16,027 --> 00:26:17,661
Actually, I calculated that.

420
00:26:17,662 --> 00:26:19,673
That's exactly how much they lost.

421
00:26:19,955 --> 00:26:21,926
Don't worry. I got you.

422
00:26:22,862 --> 00:26:24,299
Lloyd, what's up?

423
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:26,299
Lloyd!

424
00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:29,386
Elliot. This is bad.

425
00:26:29,387 --> 00:26:30,968
Worst DDoS attack I've ever seen.

426
00:26:30,969 --> 00:26:33,541
- Did you reconfigure the DNS?
- Yes!

427
00:26:33,542 --> 00:26:35,783
- Stop the services.
- I already stopped the services,

428
00:26:35,784 --> 00:26:38,160
tries to reboot the servers
but they're not coming back up.

429
00:26:38,399 --> 00:26:41,415
Dude, someone is straight up fingerblasting
their entire network right now.

430
00:26:58,613 --> 00:27:01,082
They just started reporting on the outage.

431
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:11,575
Shit. This is worse than I
thought. They're in the network?

432
00:27:11,576 --> 00:27:13,518
What's the status update?

433
00:27:13,519 --> 00:27:16,023
He's here. I thought we
set up security protocols

434
00:27:16,024 --> 00:27:19,419
so that this doesn't happen.

435
00:27:19,744 --> 00:27:21,788
- Where's the attack coming from?
- Everywhere, obviously.

436
00:27:21,789 --> 00:27:25,210
- The USA, Finland, Thailand, Kuwait...
- Start restarting the services, load sharing,

437
00:27:25,211 --> 00:27:27,348
redirect the traffic.
Call Prolexic for help.

438
00:27:27,968 --> 00:27:31,634
- Wait. What?
- I don't think this is just a DDoS attack.

439
00:27:33,599 --> 00:27:36,046
I think they got a rootkit
sitting inside the servers.

440
00:27:36,372 --> 00:27:38,927
- What's a rootkit?
- It's like a crazy serial

441
00:27:38,928 --> 00:27:40,399
rapist with a very big dick.

442
00:27:40,803 --> 00:27:44,387
- Jesus, Lloyd.
- Sorry. It's malicious code that completely

443
00:27:44,388 --> 00:27:46,961
takes over their system.
It can delete system files

444
00:27:46,962 --> 00:27:49,494
and stop programs. Viruses, worms...

445
00:27:49,495 --> 00:27:51,202
- How do we stop it?
- That's the thing.

446
00:27:51,203 --> 00:27:53,345
It's fundamentally
invisible... you can't stop it.

447
00:27:53,346 --> 00:27:54,719
All of their servers are timing out.

448
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,034
None of them are coming back up.

449
00:27:56,299 --> 00:27:58,143
That's because every
time we restart the server

450
00:27:58,144 --> 00:28:00,105
the virus replicates itself during boot up

451
00:28:00,106 --> 00:28:01,242
and crashes the host.

452
00:28:01,243 --> 00:28:02,410
_

453
00:28:02,631 --> 00:28:04,282
How are we supposed to bring up the network

454
00:28:04,283 --> 00:28:08,084
- if we can't restart the servers?
- We can't.

455
00:28:09,001 --> 00:28:11,299
Which is what they wanted.

456
00:28:11,586 --> 00:28:14,791
By defending ourselves, we ended
up spreading the virus everywhere.

457
00:28:15,859 --> 00:28:16,998
Only thing we can do

458
00:28:16,999 --> 00:28:19,299
is we've gotta take the
whole system offline,

459
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:22,328
wipe the infected servers
clean, then bring them back up.

460
00:28:24,884 --> 00:28:26,299
You're coming with me.

461
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:28,274
- Yeah.
- Lloyd.

462
00:28:28,275 --> 00:28:30,502
Tell everybody to start
taking everything offline.

463
00:28:30,503 --> 00:28:33,220
- On it.
- Uh, the server farm in Dulles.

464
00:28:33,221 --> 00:28:34,824
We're gonna need the jet.

465
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:51,145
They're booting the network back up.

466
00:28:51,146 --> 00:28:52,967
Now, you're downloading
the logs, right because...

467
00:28:52,968 --> 00:28:54,909
- Stop. Tell him to stop.
- What?

468
00:28:54,910 --> 00:28:57,199
Don't start the boot
sequence. You guys missed one.

469
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:59,964
There's an infected server up and running.

470
00:29:00,899 --> 00:29:02,899
What's the ETA before it hits this server?

471
00:29:08,599 --> 00:29:10,599
The backup server up and running?

472
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:13,373
It's ready, but it's not
configured for auto switch.

473
00:29:19,104 --> 00:29:21,805
We need to redirect the
traffic, need to switch DNS.

474
00:29:25,399 --> 00:29:27,861
You got this, you got this, you got this.

475
00:29:29,515 --> 00:29:32,452
- This is impossible.
- You got this, you got this, you got this.

476
00:29:33,074 --> 00:29:35,423
It's almost at the back server!

477
00:29:43,749 --> 00:29:45,400
We still up?

478
00:29:52,222 --> 00:29:55,894
We're okay.

479
00:29:56,099 --> 00:29:59,137
Yeah.

480
00:30:07,116 --> 00:30:08,725
Hank.

481
00:30:08,726 --> 00:30:10,527
I'm gonna take a look at
the infected server, okay?

482
00:30:10,528 --> 00:30:14,806
- Give me a minute.
- Yeah. Uh... I'll meet you at the elevators.

483
00:30:21,072 --> 00:30:22,835
They must have left a mark or something.

484
00:30:22,836 --> 00:30:24,752
Every hacker loves attention.

485
00:30:24,753 --> 00:30:27,479
They don't just do DDoS
attacks for no reason.

486
00:30:33,821 --> 00:30:36,626
This is it. fsociety.

487
00:30:37,099 --> 00:30:39,099
Is that supposed to be a joke?

488
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:42,471
This was way too easy. They
didn't hide it well at all.

489
00:30:44,431 --> 00:30:46,083
_

490
00:30:46,958 --> 00:30:49,189
_

491
00:30:50,033 --> 00:30:52,485
This note is for me.

492
00:30:53,499 --> 00:30:55,885
They're telling me to leave it here.

493
00:30:55,886 --> 00:30:59,152
But why? Doesn't matter.

494
00:30:59,153 --> 00:31:01,376
Time to shut them down.

495
00:31:04,991 --> 00:31:06,568
Why can't I delete it?

496
00:31:06,569 --> 00:31:09,081
I don't want to delete
it. I want it to stay.

497
00:31:09,082 --> 00:31:11,299
What's wrong with me?

498
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:20,735
I'll reconfigure the
access to the root directory

499
00:31:20,736 --> 00:31:23,957
so only I can use it. And no one will know.

500
00:31:28,299 --> 00:31:29,702
For you, sir.

501
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:40,302
- Did you know that I'm gay?
- Uh...

502
00:31:43,499 --> 00:31:46,331
- No.
- Hmm.

503
00:31:49,199 --> 00:31:53,199
Consider this me coming
out to you then, okay?

504
00:31:53,799 --> 00:31:55,799
It's hard because I don't
like to talk about my sex life.

505
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:59,799
But my partner, he gets very paranoid.

506
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:02,799
He thinks I'm ashamed of...

507
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:05,799
He wants me to be more public about it, so,

508
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:08,799
Anyway, I'm gay.

509
00:32:12,499 --> 00:32:14,499
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

510
00:32:20,099 --> 00:32:24,007
Hey, man, don't worry about it.

511
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:26,099
Hackers have a short attention span.

512
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:28,829
They'll get bored, harass someone else.

513
00:32:28,830 --> 00:32:33,899
Evil Corp is thinking about leaving us.

514
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:37,036
And I don't know if I can blame them.

515
00:32:38,899 --> 00:32:41,733
They could have called
their other security teams.

516
00:32:41,734 --> 00:32:43,684
- Mm.
- They called you.

517
00:32:44,899 --> 00:32:46,800
Well, somebody over there likes us,

518
00:32:46,801 --> 00:32:49,736
but Terry Colby, he's getting the pressure.

519
00:32:49,737 --> 00:32:53,722
and he calls the shots.

520
00:32:53,723 --> 00:32:56,899
Evil Corp is 80% of our business.

521
00:32:56,900 --> 00:32:59,899
If we lose them, it's gonna be it for us.

522
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:02,805
It's gonna be it...

523
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,899
For me.

524
00:33:13,352 --> 00:33:15,502
I feel like I can talk to you.

525
00:33:17,199 --> 00:33:19,845
I mean, more than the others, anyway.

526
00:33:20,899 --> 00:33:25,298
I'm sure, in a weird way,
you'll be happy if we went under.

527
00:33:25,999 --> 00:33:28,480
Oh, come on. Come on.

528
00:33:29,699 --> 00:33:32,573
I know you hate wearing
those stupid shirts.

529
00:33:41,899 --> 00:33:43,899
Gideon?

530
00:33:46,099 --> 00:33:49,099
I promise I'll find them.

531
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:04,874
Evil Corp service should
be back up soon enough.

532
00:34:04,875 --> 00:34:07,855
I'll take a look at the dat
file. I'll ask my IRC contacts

533
00:34:07,856 --> 00:34:09,649
about fsociety when I get home.

534
00:34:09,650 --> 00:34:11,706
I've never seen their
name on the boards though.

535
00:34:11,707 --> 00:34:13,899
They've gotta be new, but they're good.

536
00:34:20,899 --> 00:34:22,899
Rough night?

537
00:34:28,899 --> 00:34:30,519
I'm getting off here.

538
00:34:31,699 --> 00:34:33,699
I think you should come with me.

539
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:36,899
But only if you didn't delete it.

540
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:40,472
You deleted it, we got
nothing to talk about.

541
00:34:40,899 --> 00:34:43,761
Are you talking to me?

542
00:34:46,199 --> 00:34:50,151
Stand clear of the closing doors, please.

543
00:35:02,699 --> 00:35:07,529
- Who are you?
- We gotta wait for the Q.

544
00:35:14,899 --> 00:35:18,919
- Then what?
- Then we're going to Brooklyn.

545
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:21,735
Out by Coney Island.

546
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:23,575
Why?

547
00:35:24,248 --> 00:35:28,425
What's there?

548
00:35:28,899 --> 00:35:32,899
Obviously you're gonna
ask a lot of questions.

549
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:35,873
It's weird what you're
doing right now, I get it.

550
00:35:37,799 --> 00:35:40,799
I... I can't tell you
anything until we get there.

551
00:35:48,999 --> 00:35:51,013
Can't smoke in here.

552
00:35:55,699 --> 00:35:57,785
You've been following me.

553
00:35:58,786 --> 00:36:00,553
Why?

554
00:36:02,699 --> 00:36:05,699
What do you want from me?

555
00:36:09,699 --> 00:36:12,699
My dad was a petty thief.

556
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:14,699
Never could hold down a job.

557
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:17,953
So, he just robbed,
convenience stores, shops,

558
00:36:17,954 --> 00:36:20,023
small-time stuff.

559
00:36:20,699 --> 00:36:23,549
One time, he sat me down, he
told me something I never forgot.

560
00:36:23,699 --> 00:36:28,411
He said, "Everyone steals.
That's how it works.

561
00:36:28,412 --> 00:36:32,545
You think people out there are
getting exactly what they deserve? No.

562
00:36:32,546 --> 00:36:34,699
They're getting paid over or under,

563
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:38,088
but someone in the chain
always gets bamboozled.

564
00:36:40,295 --> 00:36:44,699
I steal, son, but I don't get caught.

565
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:47,699
That's my contract with society.

566
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:49,699
Now if you can catch me
stealing, I'll go to jail.

567
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:54,396
But if you can't, then
I've earned the money."

568
00:36:58,108 --> 00:37:00,418
I respected that, man.

569
00:37:02,699 --> 00:37:06,935
I thought that shit was
cool as a little kid.

570
00:37:10,296 --> 00:37:12,699
A few years after that,

571
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:15,699
they finally caught him.

572
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:17,764
Sent him to jail.

573
00:37:17,765 --> 00:37:21,975
Dies five years later.
My respect goes with him.

574
00:37:24,699 --> 00:37:28,556
I thought he was free doing
what he did, but he wasn't.

575
00:37:30,153 --> 00:37:32,365
He was in prison.

576
00:37:33,699 --> 00:37:36,551
Just like you are now, Elliot.

577
00:37:38,699 --> 00:37:41,699
But I'm gonna break you out.

578
00:38:37,881 --> 00:38:43,532
- Why would you guys actually meet IRL?
- You remember that hacker group O-Megz?

579
00:38:43,533 --> 00:38:45,374
They got outed by their
own leader to the FBI,

580
00:38:45,375 --> 00:38:47,067
and six hackers went to prison for it?

581
00:38:47,068 --> 00:38:48,530
You know how they got 'em?

582
00:38:48,531 --> 00:38:50,095
They went on the dude's computer,

583
00:38:50,096 --> 00:38:55,713
tracked 'em all down through emails,
VPN sessions, chat messages, texts.

584
00:38:55,714 --> 00:38:57,699
One guy, and the whole thing comes down.

585
00:38:57,700 --> 00:38:59,819
- It's what's called...
- A central point of failure.

586
00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:03,185
Right. Because they
refused to meet in person,

587
00:39:03,186 --> 00:39:07,141
they compromised each other every time
they sent so much as a smiley face.

588
00:39:07,142 --> 00:39:11,764
The rule here is, it's
done here, and only here.

589
00:39:13,699 --> 00:39:17,102
It ends when you walk out that
door, and begins when you walk in.

590
00:39:17,103 --> 00:39:21,141
Our encryption is the real world.

591
00:39:21,699 --> 00:39:24,762
- How do you talk to each other then?
- We don't.

592
00:39:24,763 --> 00:39:27,683
We come and go, work on
the project when we can.

593
00:39:28,699 --> 00:39:30,699
- How do you trust them?
- I give them an exercise.

594
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:35,691
If they pass, they join us.

595
00:39:35,899 --> 00:39:38,584
- If they fail...
- The DDoS attack last night,

596
00:39:40,249 --> 00:39:42,469
you were testing me.

597
00:39:49,284 --> 00:39:51,418
You said there was a project.

598
00:39:51,829 --> 00:39:54,966
- What's the project?
- That'll come later.

599
00:39:54,967 --> 00:39:57,328
I just wanted you to see the place.

600
00:40:02,999 --> 00:40:05,999
There's not much you can do without a CPU.

601
00:40:10,999 --> 00:40:12,356
I'm crazy.

602
00:40:12,357 --> 00:40:14,999
I have to be crazy because
that didn't just happen, right?

603
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:19,013
This is a delusion. Is this a
delusion? Shit, I'm a schizo.

604
00:40:20,999 --> 00:40:24,073
Have I really lost it this time?
No, no. Last night happened.

605
00:40:24,074 --> 00:40:26,438
It was real. Angela called
me. I was at AllSafe.

606
00:40:26,439 --> 00:40:27,999
Evil Corp's servers were compromised.

607
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,999
Those are facts, not delusions.

608
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,608
I know. I know, I know I
realize I'm saying all of this

609
00:40:32,609 --> 00:40:36,057
to an imaginary person, but I created you.

610
00:40:36,058 --> 00:40:38,493
I didn't create this.

611
00:40:38,999 --> 00:40:41,181
Oh, thank God you're here.

612
00:40:41,182 --> 00:40:43,827
I was just about to go
wait in the Starbucks.

613
00:40:44,599 --> 00:40:46,182
You live in a bad neighborhood.

614
00:40:46,183 --> 00:40:48,836
- Do you know that?
- I do know that.

615
00:40:49,399 --> 00:40:54,149
Do you want to get high and
watch your favorite movie?

616
00:40:54,999 --> 00:40:58,611
Oh, you saved our asses last night. I
thought Gideon was definitely gonna fire me.

617
00:40:59,999 --> 00:41:01,129
Where have you been?

618
00:41:01,130 --> 00:41:06,972
- I thought you'd be sleeping.
- I... yeah, I fell asleep on the train.

619
00:41:08,799 --> 00:41:11,564
That sounds like such a lie,

620
00:41:12,799 --> 00:41:15,770
but, whatever. I don't want
to get into that right now.

621
00:41:16,071 --> 00:41:18,154
So you want to do this?

622
00:41:23,499 --> 00:41:26,839
I miss Qwerty. I hope she still loves me.

623
00:41:34,799 --> 00:41:36,799
Shit.

624
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:38,972
She wasn't supposed to be here, okay?

625
00:41:38,973 --> 00:41:42,031
- Give me a minute and I'll get rid of her.
- That's okay.

626
00:41:42,032 --> 00:41:45,951
Um... This is great.

627
00:41:46,701 --> 00:41:48,997
- Elliot, I'm happy for you.
- No, it's not like that.

628
00:41:48,998 --> 00:41:53,540
Well, maybe it should be, you
know? It's good that you're...

629
00:41:55,699 --> 00:41:57,564
dating.

630
00:42:00,599 --> 00:42:02,133
Well, I'll see you on Monday.

631
00:42:02,599 --> 00:42:04,599
We can do movie night next time.

632
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:08,317
- I promise, okay?
- Yeah.

633
00:42:15,099 --> 00:42:17,006
Have fun.

634
00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:33,375
Mm, Elliot?

635
00:42:33,991 --> 00:42:38,772
Oh, shit. Is it Wednesday?

636
00:42:38,773 --> 00:42:41,840
- Shayla.
- I have to move my car.

637
00:42:41,841 --> 00:42:45,757
Shayla, leave.

638
00:42:48,116 --> 00:42:49,599
Now.

639
00:42:52,952 --> 00:42:54,770
No mention of Mr. Robot anywhere.

640
00:42:54,771 --> 00:42:56,599
No mention of fsociety.

641
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:58,116
Not on any of the hacker boards.

642
00:42:58,117 --> 00:43:02,011
Not on IRC, forums, blogs,
no one's heard of them.

643
00:43:05,914 --> 00:43:09,979
Property was owned by Fun Society
Amusement, LLC for 13 years.

644
00:43:10,499 --> 00:43:12,839
Owner was shot a killed
a year and a half ago.

645
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:14,315
No owner since.

646
00:43:14,616 --> 00:43:17,999
And the ownership history before
that is sparse to nonexistent.

647
00:43:18,399 --> 00:43:21,533
This guy is good. Very good.

648
00:43:26,909 --> 00:43:31,135
Doesn't matter. Their arcade
network's IP is in the DAT file.

649
00:43:34,599 --> 00:43:37,409
That'll be enough to turn them in.

650
00:43:51,699 --> 00:43:53,699
What's your ask, Mr. Robot?

651
00:44:04,599 --> 00:44:06,692
Hey, man,

652
00:44:07,950 --> 00:44:12,241
- where's your boss?
- Okay, cut the bullshit.

653
00:44:12,529 --> 00:44:15,628
When are you going to give us
access to the root directory?

654
00:44:16,599 --> 00:44:19,007
What? Dude, come on.

655
00:44:19,008 --> 00:44:20,599
I wrote that rootkit.

656
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:23,599
I still have to put
Colby's IP in the DAT file.

657
00:44:29,799 --> 00:44:31,683
Dickhead.

658
00:44:33,499 --> 00:44:35,951
Elliot! Good news.

659
00:44:35,952 --> 00:44:38,008
I scored the last bag of
Twinkies from Gristedes.

660
00:44:38,009 --> 00:44:41,993
- You want one?
- She just called me a dickhead.

661
00:44:42,639 --> 00:44:45,366
Yeah, that's Darlene.

662
00:44:45,367 --> 00:44:49,379
Hey, you like Ferris wheels?

663
00:44:52,599 --> 00:44:54,662
Ah, it's beautiful.

664
00:44:54,899 --> 00:44:57,145
Gets better the higher up you go, you know?

665
00:44:58,599 --> 00:45:01,599
Oh, I love it up here.

666
00:45:02,175 --> 00:45:07,283
- You like it?
- I'm here to tell you I'm turning you in.

667
00:45:07,931 --> 00:45:11,454
- I'm giving them all the information.
- Let me tell you why you're really here.

668
00:45:12,599 --> 00:45:16,108
You're here because you sense
something wrong with the world.

669
00:45:16,109 --> 00:45:18,668
Something you can't explain.

670
00:45:19,177 --> 00:45:20,760
But...

671
00:45:20,761 --> 00:45:23,519
you know it controls you
and everyone you care about.

672
00:45:24,479 --> 00:45:26,506
What are you talking about?

673
00:45:29,453 --> 00:45:31,193
Money.

674
00:45:31,499 --> 00:45:35,372
Money hasn't been real since
we got off the gold standard.

675
00:45:35,373 --> 00:45:37,044
It's become virtual.

676
00:45:37,045 --> 00:45:40,723
Software. The operating
system of our world.

677
00:45:41,402 --> 00:45:46,952
And, Elliot, we are on the verge
of taking down this virtual reality.

678
00:45:49,348 --> 00:45:50,885
Think about it.

679
00:45:51,434 --> 00:45:55,634
What if you could take
down one conglomerate?

680
00:45:56,253 --> 00:45:59,631
A conglomerate so deeply entrenched

681
00:45:59,632 --> 00:46:04,378
in the world's economy, that "too big to fail"
doesn't even come close to describing it.

682
00:46:04,968 --> 00:46:07,445
You want to create
another financial meltdown

683
00:46:07,446 --> 00:46:11,017
like the one we just had, but way worse.

684
00:46:11,018 --> 00:46:12,712
Yeah, why would I want that?

685
00:46:13,059 --> 00:46:14,358
Everyone would lose their money.

686
00:46:14,359 --> 00:46:16,440
What if I told you that this conglomerate

687
00:46:16,441 --> 00:46:20,110
just so happens to own 70% of the
global consumer credit industry?

688
00:46:20,111 --> 00:46:22,686
Huh? If we hit their
data center just right,

689
00:46:22,687 --> 00:46:25,019
we could systematically
format all the servers,

690
00:46:25,020 --> 00:46:27,129
- including backup.
- That would erase all...

691
00:46:27,130 --> 00:46:29,350
All the debt we owe them.

692
00:46:29,351 --> 00:46:32,528
Every record of every credit
card, loan, and mortgage

693
00:46:32,529 --> 00:46:33,991
would be wiped clean.

694
00:46:35,062 --> 00:46:36,293
It would be impossible to reinforce

695
00:46:36,295 --> 00:46:37,758
outdated paper records.

696
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:40,788
It would all be gone.

697
00:46:40,790 --> 00:46:43,387
The single biggest incident

698
00:46:43,389 --> 00:46:47,450
of wealth redistribution in history.

699
00:46:53,047 --> 00:46:57,308
Evil Corp. The conglomerate.

700
00:46:57,310 --> 00:46:59,206
That's why you picked me.

701
00:46:59,208 --> 00:47:00,772
Because I work at AllSafe.

702
00:47:00,774 --> 00:47:03,936
Tomorrow, AllSafe is going to get a visit

703
00:47:03,938 --> 00:47:07,999
from the FBI and the U.S. Cyber Command.

704
00:47:08,001 --> 00:47:12,429
You are going to modify the DAT file

705
00:47:12,431 --> 00:47:17,258
and put Colby's terminal
IP address in there.

706
00:47:17,260 --> 00:47:19,889
Terry Colby?

707
00:47:19,891 --> 00:47:24,019
You're gonna frame him? No
one's gonna believe that.

708
00:47:24,021 --> 00:47:26,316
I met him, he's a moron.

709
00:47:26,318 --> 00:47:28,182
So are the FBI.

710
00:47:28,184 --> 00:47:29,914
Even if they don't believe he did it,

711
00:47:29,916 --> 00:47:33,311
they'll believe he gave
someone access to it.

712
00:47:33,313 --> 00:47:34,877
Yeah, he'll just go to jail.

713
00:47:34,879 --> 00:47:37,775
- What good will that do?
- You don't take down a conglomerate

714
00:47:37,776 --> 00:47:39,706
by shooting them in the heart.

715
00:47:39,708 --> 00:47:41,271
That's the thing about conglomerates,

716
00:47:41,273 --> 00:47:43,269
they don't have hearts.

717
00:47:43,271 --> 00:47:46,034
You take them down limb by limb.

718
00:47:46,036 --> 00:47:47,433
And as they unravel,

719
00:47:47,435 --> 00:47:50,697
their illusion of control unravels.

720
00:47:56,693 --> 00:48:01,605
- Who are you?
- That'll come later.

721
00:48:01,656 --> 00:48:06,283
Right now, you have a lot to think about.

722
00:48:06,285 --> 00:48:08,914
You have to change the DAT file

723
00:48:08,916 --> 00:48:11,978
and put Colby's IP in there.

724
00:48:14,645 --> 00:48:17,174
You do that,

725
00:48:17,176 --> 00:48:19,339
you have set in motion
the largest revolution

726
00:48:19,341 --> 00:48:22,703
the world will ever see.

727
00:50:55,183 --> 00:51:00,737
- So, what do we got?
- So, if you'll take a look

728
00:51:00,738 --> 00:51:02,235
at the first page of your agenda...

729
00:51:02,237 --> 00:51:05,699
You're the one who stopped the hack.

730
00:51:05,701 --> 00:51:08,796
You know, the gals in analysis
said this was a tough one.

731
00:51:08,798 --> 00:51:10,229
All things being equal,

732
00:51:10,231 --> 00:51:12,793
it should have shut us down for days, so...

733
00:51:12,795 --> 00:51:15,224
you did good.

734
00:51:15,226 --> 00:51:18,754
Okay.

735
00:51:18,756 --> 00:51:22,152
We should start with our
account executive, Angela.

736
00:51:22,154 --> 00:51:23,950
Okay, we first noticed the breach

737
00:51:23,952 --> 00:51:27,947
at 2:07 A.M. Eastern
Standard on Friday night.

738
00:51:28,354 --> 00:51:32,363
- You mean, Saturday?
- Sorry, yes,

739
00:51:32,364 --> 00:51:34,378
technically, Saturday morning.

740
00:51:34,379 --> 00:51:36,905
Yeah, okay, Angela,
that's what we're here for.

741
00:51:36,907 --> 00:51:39,204
The technicals.

742
00:51:39,998 --> 00:51:41,325
Right.

743
00:51:42,001 --> 00:51:45,581
Yes. Anyway, he arrived at the office

744
00:51:45,582 --> 00:51:47,707
- at 2:35 and I instru...
- Okay, wait, wait, wait.

745
00:51:48,708 --> 00:51:50,339
So that's almost a half hour
after the initial breach.

746
00:51:50,340 --> 00:51:52,179
Why didn't anyone pipe
in from their laptops?

747
00:51:52,180 --> 00:51:54,458
- It's not protocol...
- It wouldn't have been secure

748
00:51:54,460 --> 00:51:57,855
if someone terminaled in on this.

749
00:51:57,857 --> 00:52:01,552
It was the smarter move
to have someone come in

750
00:52:01,554 --> 00:52:04,511
- so they can log in on a secure line.
- Exactly.

751
00:52:04,512 --> 00:52:06,824
- Then Lloyd was able to...
- Just... just actually,

752
00:52:06,825 --> 00:52:08,738
just one second.

753
00:52:08,980 --> 00:52:13,075
Yeah.

754
00:52:21,837 --> 00:52:23,933
You know, I, uh,

755
00:52:23,935 --> 00:52:27,962
I always loved this view.

756
00:52:42,819 --> 00:52:44,982
Now that that's taken care of,

757
00:52:44,984 --> 00:52:47,746
let's pick it up where we left off.

758
00:52:47,748 --> 00:52:49,044
What happened to Angela?

759
00:52:49,046 --> 00:52:50,877
She knows more about what happened.

760
00:52:50,879 --> 00:52:53,075
She's not going to work out
for us, not on this level.

761
00:52:53,077 --> 00:52:55,831
We need to stick to the
more tech savvy here.

762
00:52:59,206 --> 00:53:01,335
Now, let's get to the heart of this thing

763
00:53:01,337 --> 00:53:03,467
because I can't sit here

764
00:53:03,469 --> 00:53:06,684
and look through a packet
for the next 20 minutes.

765
00:53:07,698 --> 00:53:11,278
All right, just who did
this? Is it that hard?

766
00:53:12,061 --> 00:53:17,531
- Who did this?
- I found the configuration file

767
00:53:17,532 --> 00:53:20,148
of the rootkit with a
pattern of IP addresses.

768
00:53:23,485 --> 00:53:28,013
Once you decrypt it, you'll
know where the hack came from.

769
00:53:40,143 --> 00:53:42,324
19 days.

770
00:53:45,905 --> 00:53:49,389
No news, no arrests, no revolution.

771
00:54:01,758 --> 00:54:05,820
No FBI, Colby, Evil Corp.

772
00:54:08,597 --> 00:54:11,905
_

773
00:54:20,409 --> 00:54:22,738
No Mr. Robot.

774
00:54:22,740 --> 00:54:24,804
No fsociety.

775
00:54:32,865 --> 00:54:35,928
I need to take my mind off things.

776
00:54:45,954 --> 00:54:48,570
- Hello.
- Hi, this is Sam

777
00:54:48,571 --> 00:54:51,015
from Bank of E security fraud department.

778
00:54:51,017 --> 00:54:52,913
Unfortunately I have to inform you

779
00:54:52,915 --> 00:54:54,712
that your account's been compromised.

780
00:54:55,714 --> 00:54:58,991
- What? What happened?
- First before I can answer any questions,

781
00:54:58,992 --> 00:55:00,587
I need to verify some information.

782
00:55:00,588 --> 00:55:05,022
- Are you still at 306 Hawthorne Avenue?
- Yes. Apartment 2C.

783
00:55:05,023 --> 00:55:07,192
- _
- Great. And your security question,

784
00:55:07,193 --> 00:55:10,593
- favorite baseball team?
- Um, Yankees.

785
00:55:10,594 --> 00:55:12,198
I don't remember this
being a security question.

786
00:55:12,199 --> 00:55:15,782
- And lastly, your pet's name?
- Um, Flipper.

787
00:55:15,783 --> 00:55:19,557
Who am I speaking to? Can
I get your name and number?

788
00:55:19,559 --> 00:55:21,889
With those details plus a
dictionary brute-force attack,

789
00:55:21,891 --> 00:55:26,085
it'll take my program maybe two
minutes to crack his password.

790
00:55:33,714 --> 00:55:36,909
What I wouldn't give to be normal.

791
00:55:36,911 --> 00:55:39,973
To live in that bubble,

792
00:55:39,975 --> 00:55:42,771
the reality of the naive.

793
00:55:46,237 --> 00:55:51,131
That's how I justify this.

794
00:55:51,133 --> 00:55:54,229
To keep their optimism intact.

795
00:55:54,231 --> 00:55:57,692
To protect them.

796
00:56:00,150 --> 00:56:01,439
_

797
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:03,628
How? He's too old to have
a complicated password.

798
00:56:03,629 --> 00:56:06,552
It had to have been a
combination of these things.

799
00:56:10,151 --> 00:56:11,614
I'm missing something,
I'm missing something,

800
00:56:11,616 --> 00:56:16,044
I'm missing something.

801
00:56:16,046 --> 00:56:17,709
Michael Hansen isn't his real name.

802
00:56:26,970 --> 00:56:29,033
Come on. Get over here.

803
00:56:32,132 --> 00:56:33,562
Lenny Shannon?

804
00:56:33,564 --> 00:56:36,160
Michael Hansen?

805
00:56:36,162 --> 00:56:39,624
Which one are you playing tonight?

806
00:56:39,626 --> 00:56:42,143
- You're going to stop seeing Krista.
- What the f...

807
00:56:43,144 --> 00:56:45,433
You're going to break up with her.
You're never going to see her again.

808
00:56:46,752 --> 00:56:49,449
You're the guy that used my phone.

809
00:56:49,451 --> 00:56:51,880
You cheated on your current
wife with seven different women.

810
00:56:51,882 --> 00:56:53,882
I got digital proof of all of it.

811
00:56:53,883 --> 00:56:57,808
Ashley Madison, online
escorts, fake Facebook pages.

812
00:56:57,810 --> 00:56:59,973
I own it all.

813
00:56:59,975 --> 00:57:01,872
And if you don't stop seeing her,

814
00:57:01,874 --> 00:57:06,001
your wife will know everything
along with the police.

815
00:57:06,003 --> 00:57:09,226
- The police?
- Yeah, one of the escorts was 15.

816
00:57:13,364 --> 00:57:14,636
That 15 part I made up,

817
00:57:14,637 --> 00:57:16,692
but he did have a
proclivity for young escorts

818
00:57:16,694 --> 00:57:18,024
that helped the lie.

819
00:57:18,026 --> 00:57:20,555
But I'm not gonna do any of that

820
00:57:20,557 --> 00:57:23,087
as long as you break up with Krista.

821
00:57:23,089 --> 00:57:25,152
Tonight.

822
00:57:29,183 --> 00:57:32,046
Done.

823
00:57:32,048 --> 00:57:34,211
You're also gonna tell her the truth.

824
00:57:34,213 --> 00:57:36,242
That you're married, cheat on your wife,

825
00:57:36,244 --> 00:57:38,507
you hire hookers.

826
00:57:38,509 --> 00:57:41,637
That you never had any intention
of being serious with her.

827
00:57:41,639 --> 00:57:43,070
Why?

828
00:57:43,072 --> 00:57:44,169
That would destroy her.

829
00:57:44,171 --> 00:57:46,500
She thinks that...

830
00:57:46,502 --> 00:57:48,466
We're in love.

831
00:57:48,468 --> 00:57:50,996
Exactly. Krista needs to
avoid dickheads like you

832
00:57:50,998 --> 00:57:52,162
in the future.

833
00:57:52,164 --> 00:57:54,726
Her radar needs fixing.

834
00:57:54,728 --> 00:57:57,658
I'll know if you skip any detail.

835
00:57:57,660 --> 00:58:01,821
So don't.

836
00:58:01,823 --> 00:58:04,785
And one more thing...

837
00:58:04,787 --> 00:58:07,715
I'm gonna need something from you.

838
00:58:11,581 --> 00:58:13,578
Come on.

839
00:58:24,503 --> 00:58:28,798
Hmm. I like you, Flipper.

840
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:32,061
You're cool.

841
00:58:32,063 --> 00:58:34,161
I never want to be right about my hacks,

842
00:58:34,163 --> 00:58:36,925
but people always find a way to disappoint.

843
00:58:44,254 --> 00:58:47,916
Michael Hansen now gets
filed away among the others.

844
00:58:47,918 --> 00:58:50,281
Forever buried in my digital cemetery.

845
00:58:59,508 --> 00:59:01,504
The look of disillusionment.

846
00:59:01,506 --> 00:59:04,068
He told her. She cried all night.

847
00:59:04,070 --> 00:59:06,167
Now comes the sadness.

848
00:59:06,169 --> 00:59:08,595
I don't like seeing her sad.

849
00:59:12,130 --> 00:59:15,359
- You okay?
- Sorry.

850
00:59:15,361 --> 00:59:17,062
Sorry.

851
00:59:18,958 --> 00:59:22,154
Go on.

852
00:59:22,156 --> 00:59:24,452
I think Angela blames me for what happened

853
00:59:24,454 --> 00:59:26,916
at the Evil Corp meeting.

854
00:59:26,918 --> 00:59:29,248
What do I do? I need to talk to her.

855
00:59:29,250 --> 00:59:32,545
I think you just answered
your own question.

856
00:59:32,547 --> 00:59:34,144
Talk to her.

857
00:59:34,146 --> 00:59:36,772
She won't respond to any
of my texts or emails.

858
00:59:36,773 --> 00:59:38,873
Then go to her in person.

859
00:59:38,875 --> 00:59:42,037
Tell her you need to talk.

860
00:59:42,039 --> 00:59:45,401
Communication is key, Elliot.

861
00:59:45,403 --> 00:59:50,663
Real human interaction.

862
00:59:50,665 --> 00:59:53,360
That's what's important for you right now.

863
01:00:03,687 --> 01:00:07,049
Hey. Do you...

864
01:00:07,051 --> 01:00:09,314
- Do you think we can talk?
- What?

865
01:00:09,316 --> 01:00:10,912
You won't talk to me.

866
01:00:10,914 --> 01:00:12,311
You haven't talked to me since the meeting.

867
01:00:12,313 --> 01:00:13,809
I don't want to talk to you

868
01:00:13,811 --> 01:00:17,173
because I feel embarrassed

869
01:00:17,175 --> 01:00:19,271
every time I think about what happened.

870
01:00:19,273 --> 01:00:21,137
Okay?

871
01:00:21,139 --> 01:00:24,167
It's fine. I'll get over it.

872
01:00:24,169 --> 01:00:26,102
- It's been three weeks.
- I have to get back to work.

873
01:00:26,103 --> 01:00:28,859
- You're just going to ignore me?
- You didn't have to stick up for me in there.

874
01:00:29,832 --> 01:00:31,261
I know that you were just trying to help,

875
01:00:31,263 --> 01:00:34,892
just don't do it again.

876
01:00:34,894 --> 01:00:36,724
Even if I'm losing.

877
01:00:36,726 --> 01:00:39,591
Let me lose, okay?

878
01:00:41,222 --> 01:00:43,784
Don't look confused.

879
01:00:43,786 --> 01:00:46,915
Just say it.

880
01:00:46,917 --> 01:00:49,166
"Okay."

881
01:00:51,846 --> 01:00:53,872
Okay.

882
01:01:08,799 --> 01:01:10,861
Elliott.

883
01:01:28,248 --> 01:01:32,010
FBI agents claim that Colby
either used hacking groups

884
01:01:32,011 --> 01:01:33,927
or worked in conjunction with them

885
01:01:33,928 --> 01:01:37,273
to pressure Evil Corp during
his contract negotiations.

886
01:01:37,275 --> 01:01:40,103
After a long and exhaustive investigation,

887
01:01:40,105 --> 01:01:44,334
sources close to the FBI
have confirmed the hacks were

888
01:01:44,336 --> 01:01:47,930
in part tied to Colby's terminal.

889
01:01:51,263 --> 01:01:54,725
It's happening, it's happening,
it's happening, it's happening.

890
01:02:03,386 --> 01:02:05,449
It's happening, it's happening,
it's happening, it's happening.

891
01:02:22,404 --> 01:02:26,465
Sir, step inside the car.

892
01:02:30,097 --> 01:02:31,694
Sir.

893
01:02:35,526 --> 01:02:37,922
Step inside the vehicle now.

894
01:03:09,231 --> 01:03:11,327
Go ahead.

895
01:03:11,329 --> 01:03:13,392
Sir, go on in.

896
01:03:17,091 --> 01:03:19,153
Sir, go on in.

897
01:04:12,212 --> 01:04:15,106
Bonsoir, Elliot.

898
01:04:16,941 --> 01:04:19,237
Please tell me you're seeing this, too.

899
01:04:20,952 --> 01:04:25,207
