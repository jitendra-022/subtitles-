1
00:00:41,166 --> 00:00:43,833
What is the responsibility
of those with power?

2
00:00:44,708 --> 00:00:49,625
Do they merely have an obligation
to refrain from the misuse of that power?

3
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:52,166
Or do they have a duty
to protect those without it?

4
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:53,750
Two rhetorical questions.

5
00:00:53,833 --> 00:00:55,916
The defendant used
their limitless resources,

6
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,791
political and monetary, for financial gain
at the expense of public safety,

7
00:01:00,875 --> 00:01:03,750
- causing the deaths of innocent people.
- It's so wordy.

8
00:01:03,833 --> 00:01:07,208
They did this because they believed
they would not be held accountable.

9
00:01:07,291 --> 00:01:11,416
That their power shielded them
from very real consequences.

10
00:01:11,916 --> 00:01:15,250
But today, you, the jury,
can prove that's not the case.

11
00:01:15,333 --> 00:01:16,333
More smiles.

12
00:01:16,458 --> 00:01:18,416
Show them that they will
be held accountable,

13
00:01:18,791 --> 00:01:21,000
because those with the most power

14
00:01:21,875 --> 00:01:23,500
have the most to answer for.

15
00:01:23,916 --> 00:01:25,916
And you win the case.

16
00:01:26,291 --> 00:01:28,208
And you are not helpful here at all.

17
00:01:28,291 --> 00:01:30,500
This is gonna land better coming from me.

18
00:01:30,583 --> 00:01:33,666
Plenty of time to switch
things up and let me do the closing.

19
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:36,083
Dennis, you don't know but I will kill you

20
00:01:36,166 --> 00:01:38,708
and Jen won't prosecute.
So I will get away with it.

21
00:01:38,791 --> 00:01:41,583
It's a conflict of interest.
I don't condone murder. Bye, Dennis.

22
00:01:41,666 --> 00:01:43,791
You're gonna listen to a paralegal
over a lawyer?

23
00:01:43,875 --> 00:01:45,166
Yeah.

24
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:47,250
-This is unprofessional.
-That was so good.

25
00:01:47,333 --> 00:01:48,500
-It was so good.
-Seriously?

26
00:01:48,583 --> 00:01:52,166
How you used the weight of civic duty
during your closing argument?

27
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:53,791
I almost cried during parts of it.

28
00:01:53,875 --> 00:01:55,916
Now top it off
with a savage Jen Walters look.

29
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,291
What? I don't have a savage
Jen Walters look.

30
00:01:58,375 --> 00:01:59,541
There it is.

31
00:02:00,125 --> 00:02:01,750
-That was perfect.
-Okay. Really?

32
00:02:01,833 --> 00:02:03,791
- Do you think so?
- Yes. Come on.

33
00:02:03,875 --> 00:02:05,166
It's amazing. It's so great.

34
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:09,541
Jen, there is a reason why you were
handpicked to go against GLK and H, okay?

35
00:02:09,625 --> 00:02:11,666
The leveling up is happening.
This is good.

36
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:14,458
My little genius is gonna be
a district attorney one day.

37
00:02:14,541 --> 00:02:18,500
Ah, maybe one day,
but right now I just need to

38
00:02:18,625 --> 00:02:20,458
-stick the landing on this case.
-You will.

39
00:02:20,541 --> 00:02:23,958
And if it doesn't go our way,
you can just Hulk out?

40
00:02:24,041 --> 00:02:25,083
Blow everyone's minds?

41
00:02:25,166 --> 00:02:28,625
Well, the only Hulking out I'm gonna do
is in the legal sense.

42
00:02:28,708 --> 00:02:29,916
Oh, no, Jen.

43
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,750
- No?
- No, that's not funny, Jen.

44
00:02:31,833 --> 00:02:34,208
-I only tell it to you.
-Yeah.

45
00:02:34,291 --> 00:02:35,666
One sec.

46
00:02:37,291 --> 00:02:41,500
Yeah, about that. Um, it's true.
I am a Hulk.

47
00:02:41,583 --> 00:02:43,625
Uh, and I'm guessing you won't be able to

48
00:02:43,708 --> 00:02:46,541
focus on this fun lawyer show
until you know all about that.

49
00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:48,208
So, let me get you up to speed.

50
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:52,166
<i>A few months ago, I went on a road trip</i>
<i>with my cousin Bruce.</i>

51
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:55,333
Yeah, and it worked.
I mean, my arm started to heal.

52
00:02:55,416 --> 00:02:58,125
- No one thought it was...
<i>- Yes, that Bruce.</i>

53
00:02:58,208 --> 00:03:01,958
It's all because I made this little device
which keeps me in human form.

54
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:05,791
That was the longest answer to
"what've you been up to" I've ever heard.

55
00:03:05,916 --> 00:03:08,791
Well, you asked me, so I answered.

56
00:03:08,916 --> 00:03:10,875
What's up with this?

57
00:03:11,625 --> 00:03:13,375
-Cheetos and chopsticks?
-Yes.

58
00:03:13,458 --> 00:03:15,708
So you don't get Cheetos fingers.

59
00:03:15,791 --> 00:03:19,875
-My God. That's really smart.
-You're not the only genius in the family.

60
00:03:19,958 --> 00:03:22,208
No, there's also Ched.

61
00:03:22,291 --> 00:03:26,041
Okay. So, back to what
I was saying before, my theory.

62
00:03:26,208 --> 00:03:27,250
-Oh, God.
-Um,

63
00:03:27,333 --> 00:03:30,375
Steve Rogers did not have a girlfriend
before he went into the service.

64
00:03:30,916 --> 00:03:33,041
-Says who?
-The History Channel.

65
00:03:33,125 --> 00:03:35,041
So, he becomes Captain America.

66
00:03:35,125 --> 00:03:37,333
And from that moment on,
a symbol of America,

67
00:03:37,416 --> 00:03:40,416
he is rushed to the frontlines,
he becomes a war hero.

68
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:43,708
-Then he is frozen in ice.
-Right.

69
00:03:43,791 --> 00:03:45,833
So, based on everything
you've told me,

70
00:03:46,291 --> 00:03:49,458
after he gets unfrozen,
he goes from world-threatening disaster

71
00:03:49,541 --> 00:03:51,125
to world-threatening disaster.

72
00:03:51,208 --> 00:03:53,875
That's when he's not
a fugitive from the law, right?

73
00:03:53,958 --> 00:03:57,708
So it seems like
he was pretty, pretty busy.

74
00:03:57,791 --> 00:03:59,500
All you're doing is repeating everything

75
00:03:59,583 --> 00:04:01,708
that I've told you about
my friend and colleague.

76
00:04:01,791 --> 00:04:04,916
-Obviously, Captain America was a virgin.
-Look out!

77
00:04:37,666 --> 00:04:38,875
Bruce.

78
00:04:47,041 --> 00:04:48,666
Bruce.

79
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:53,208
Okay.

80
00:04:53,291 --> 00:04:54,333
Okay.

81
00:04:54,416 --> 00:04:56,916
No, Jen. Jen, I'm bleeding.

82
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,708
The inhibitor.

83
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:01,416
Jen, get away from me. I'm bleeding.

84
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:02,541
Get away.

85
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:36,875
Ooh!

86
00:06:36,958 --> 00:06:38,041
Girl, what happened to you?

87
00:06:38,125 --> 00:06:39,500
Who did this to you?

88
00:06:39,583 --> 00:06:40,791
Are you okay?

89
00:06:40,875 --> 00:06:43,500
No judgments. Whoever did this
to you does not care about you.

90
00:06:43,666 --> 00:06:45,916
You do not need him. Or her. Or them.

91
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,791
You need shoes. This is a public bathroom.

92
00:06:47,875 --> 00:06:49,958
Right. I got some here.
Take these. Right there.

93
00:06:51,291 --> 00:06:52,333
Put this on.

94
00:06:52,416 --> 00:06:54,875
Oh, thank you.
But I just need to get cleaned up.

95
00:06:54,958 --> 00:06:56,583
No need to put makeup on me.

96
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:58,875
-Yes, you do.
-Do you have anywhere to go?

97
00:06:58,958 --> 00:07:03,583
I have to call my cousin to get me.
Can I borrow somebody's phone?

98
00:07:03,666 --> 00:07:05,791
Here. Sure. Here you go.

99
00:07:08,291 --> 00:07:10,708
- All right, we're out.
- Ladies' night was a bust.

100
00:07:10,791 --> 00:07:13,125
- Take care, guys.
- Where we goin', fellas?

101
00:07:13,208 --> 00:07:15,375
- I don't know. He has the keys.
- Hey.

102
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
What's up?

103
00:07:17,791 --> 00:07:19,458
-How you doin'?
-Fine. Thank you.

104
00:07:19,541 --> 00:07:20,583
You with anyone?

105
00:07:21,041 --> 00:07:23,291
-I'm waiting for my ride.
-What's your name?

106
00:07:23,375 --> 00:07:26,083
- I think my boyfriend's coming.
- Oh, come on. Where you going?

107
00:07:26,166 --> 00:07:27,166
Let us keep you company.

108
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:29,250
Hey, we're just being friendly.

109
00:07:29,333 --> 00:07:32,041
-Yeah. Where you going?
-So what? You too good to talk to us?

110
00:08:18,291 --> 00:08:19,291
Hello?

111
00:08:33,625 --> 00:08:34,625
Hello?

112
00:08:45,208 --> 00:08:46,208
Hello?

113
00:08:54,416 --> 00:08:55,458
Hello?

114
00:08:57,708 --> 00:08:58,791
Good morning.

115
00:08:59,291 --> 00:09:01,541
Sorry. I thought I'd get
a little work done.

116
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:03,041
You're Hulk again.

117
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:04,500
Smart Hulk.

118
00:09:04,583 --> 00:09:05,916
Wow.

119
00:09:06,041 --> 00:09:07,541
Yeah. I didn't come up with it.

120
00:09:07,625 --> 00:09:10,375
You never have a choice
with these names.

121
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,875
Where are we?

122
00:09:12,958 --> 00:09:14,250
Mexico.

123
00:09:14,333 --> 00:09:17,291
Don't worry. I talked to your parents.
They know we're okay.

124
00:09:18,125 --> 00:09:20,583
This is where I spent
The Blip fixing myself

125
00:09:20,666 --> 00:09:23,000
and integrating
the Hulk-Banner identities.

126
00:09:23,083 --> 00:09:27,208
In this tiny beach house lab.

127
00:09:27,291 --> 00:09:30,541
Yeah. Tony built it for me
a few years ago.

128
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,625
-Tony Stark.
-Oh, right, right, right.

129
00:09:34,083 --> 00:09:35,666
He used to joke that it was a loaner,

130
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:38,500
and that one day he'd just
swing by and take it back.

131
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:42,458
You okay?

132
00:09:45,416 --> 00:09:46,416
Wait.

133
00:09:47,166 --> 00:09:49,208
-Did we hit a spaceship?
-Yeah.

134
00:09:49,291 --> 00:09:51,375
Sakaaran Class-Eight courier craft.

135
00:09:51,458 --> 00:09:53,208
Probably trying to deliver a message.

136
00:09:53,291 --> 00:09:54,875
I gotta get to the bottom of that.

137
00:09:54,958 --> 00:09:57,666
You know, weird stuff just kinda
finds you when you're a Hulk.

138
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:59,583
But first, we gotta deal with you.

139
00:10:00,375 --> 00:10:02,500
Me? What happened to me?

140
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:06,750
I changed.

141
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:09,541
Look.

142
00:10:09,833 --> 00:10:10,958
I'm sorry.

143
00:10:11,041 --> 00:10:12,250
I tried to warn you.

144
00:10:12,791 --> 00:10:14,416
My blood got into your system,

145
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:18,916
and after the wreck,
you got a lethal dose of gamma radiation.

146
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,458
Lethal?

147
00:10:20,541 --> 00:10:21,625
As in I'm gonna die?

148
00:10:21,708 --> 00:10:24,458
No, there is more to it
that I'm going to explain.

149
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:25,791
That is not the sentence

150
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:27,833
- to take a pause on, Bruce!
- Okay.

151
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:29,583
Look. Look.

152
00:10:30,416 --> 00:10:34,583
You and I, we share a rare
combination of genetic factors

153
00:10:34,666 --> 00:10:38,291
that allow us to synthesize
gamma radiation

154
00:10:38,833 --> 00:10:40,416
into somethin' else.

155
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:43,791
So I turn into a Hulk now, too.

156
00:10:43,875 --> 00:10:45,666
I've been analyzing your blood.

157
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:47,791
And the way it synthesized gamma,

158
00:10:47,875 --> 00:10:50,791
I was able to use it
to completely heal my arm.

159
00:10:50,875 --> 00:10:51,916
Oh.

160
00:10:52,291 --> 00:10:53,458
Because I'm better than you?

161
00:10:53,625 --> 00:10:56,208
Mmm. It's basically different.

162
00:10:56,291 --> 00:10:57,291
In a better way.

163
00:10:57,375 --> 00:11:00,041
In conclusion, my arm is healed

164
00:11:00,125 --> 00:11:02,791
and now I'm able to be
my fully integrated self again.

165
00:11:03,375 --> 00:11:04,375
Smug Hulk.

166
00:11:04,833 --> 00:11:05,833
Smart Hulk.

167
00:11:05,916 --> 00:11:08,333
Well, it's pretty smug
to call yourself smart.

168
00:11:08,416 --> 00:11:09,750
I didn't come up with it.

169
00:11:09,833 --> 00:11:11,541
You use it. Implied endorsement.

170
00:11:11,625 --> 00:11:12,666
Don't lawyer me.

171
00:11:13,375 --> 00:11:17,416
So, now that I've actually
analyzed your blood samples...

172
00:11:25,208 --> 00:11:26,833
It's a bit dramatic.

173
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,750
It's way too dangerous
to get out in the world,

174
00:11:29,833 --> 00:11:33,208
even if there's only a millionth percent
chance that it makes another one of us.

175
00:11:33,291 --> 00:11:35,500
Okay. You've analyzed everything.

176
00:11:35,583 --> 00:11:37,875
Now fix me. Get me back to normal.

177
00:11:37,958 --> 00:11:41,291
Jen, this is not goin' away.

178
00:11:41,375 --> 00:11:42,458
What do you mean?

179
00:11:42,541 --> 00:11:45,500
Give me that little device thing
that you had that kept you as Bruce.

180
00:11:45,583 --> 00:11:47,625
That device was a prototype.

181
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:50,125
-It was calibrated to me...
-Great. Make me one.

182
00:11:50,208 --> 00:11:51,958
For me. Calibrate it to me.

183
00:11:52,041 --> 00:11:53,625
-I can't do it, Jen.
-Yes, you can.

184
00:11:53,708 --> 00:11:56,416
Jen, I have been struggling
with this for years.

185
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:59,333
The best that I could do
was merge my two halves.

186
00:11:59,416 --> 00:12:02,291
Give it time in the lab,
we could possibly do the same for you.

187
00:12:02,375 --> 00:12:05,041
No. No. I don't want to be a Hulk.

188
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:07,083
God. I just got my own office.

189
00:12:07,166 --> 00:12:08,708
-This is it.
-I have business cards.

190
00:12:08,791 --> 00:12:11,625
There is no goin' back
to what you were before.

191
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:14,666
Oh, what?

192
00:12:15,708 --> 00:12:17,333
Jen, what is it? What do you need?

193
00:12:18,708 --> 00:12:20,708
I need...

194
00:12:28,583 --> 00:12:29,583
You feeling better?

195
00:12:32,083 --> 00:12:33,083
Listen...

196
00:12:35,625 --> 00:12:37,000
I know this is hard to hear,

197
00:12:37,083 --> 00:12:40,000
but you're gonna have to change
the way you live your life now.

198
00:12:40,666 --> 00:12:44,000
Avoid stressful situations,
stay away from people and...

199
00:12:44,083 --> 00:12:46,541
I can't stay away from people.
How am I supposed to work?

200
00:12:46,708 --> 00:12:48,708
You can't go back to your job.

201
00:12:50,583 --> 00:12:53,916
You stay here until you figure out
how to control your Hulk self.

202
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,416
Well, how long is that gonna take?

203
00:12:55,500 --> 00:13:00,083
This is a multi-year journey
you're about to embark on,

204
00:13:00,166 --> 00:13:02,333
on coming to terms with being the Hulk.

205
00:13:02,416 --> 00:13:05,333
I traced all of my steps
through my evolution.

206
00:13:05,416 --> 00:13:09,000
I never thought that it would end up
being a syllabus, but here we are.

207
00:13:09,083 --> 00:13:11,541
Now, with my help, hopefully,

208
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:14,416
your progress will go
a little bit faster than mine.

209
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:16,041
You said "multi-year"?

210
00:13:16,958 --> 00:13:18,750
About 15 years, give or take.

211
00:13:18,833 --> 00:13:19,833
Fifteen years?

212
00:13:19,916 --> 00:13:22,291
Our top priority is to control
when you turn.

213
00:13:26,875 --> 00:13:30,166
I thought the point was to prevent me
from turning into a Hulk.

214
00:13:30,666 --> 00:13:34,041
These transformations are triggered
by distressed emotional states

215
00:13:34,125 --> 00:13:37,375
so we need to know the exact
threshold that causes it for you.

216
00:13:37,458 --> 00:13:39,083
Ooh! Put on a Pixar movie.

217
00:13:39,166 --> 00:13:42,708
When Bing Bong jumps out
of the wagon in <i>Inside Out.</i>

218
00:13:42,791 --> 00:13:43,958
Bing Bong. No. No.

219
00:13:44,041 --> 00:13:45,041
Stop.

220
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:46,500
I need to focus.

221
00:13:47,083 --> 00:13:49,041
The triggers are anger and fear.

222
00:13:49,125 --> 00:13:53,208
Those are, like, the baseline
of any woman just existing.

223
00:13:53,291 --> 00:13:54,500
All right. Let's try this.

224
00:13:58,458 --> 00:13:59,458
Bruce.

225
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,666
It kinda feels like if I don't transform,
I'm gonna die.

226
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:06,125
Do you have a plan B for that?

227
00:14:06,208 --> 00:14:07,666
- No.
- No?

228
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:09,625
Ha-ha. Not funny, Bruce.

229
00:14:09,708 --> 00:14:11,083
What, you're just gonna kill me?

230
00:14:11,166 --> 00:14:13,708
-Put the helmet on! We need the data!
-This isn't gonna work!

231
00:14:14,458 --> 00:14:16,958
What do you normally use
this chamber for, you psychopath?

232
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:23,833
Yes! Yes. Yes.

233
00:14:23,916 --> 00:14:25,166
No. No.

234
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:27,916
No, no, no.

235
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
No.

236
00:14:30,166 --> 00:14:31,791
No. No. No.

237
00:14:33,208 --> 00:14:34,625
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

238
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:37,333
Easy, girl. Easy.

239
00:14:37,416 --> 00:14:38,416
Easy.

240
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:41,083
Why are you talking to me
like I'm a stray horse?

241
00:14:41,458 --> 00:14:42,458
Jen?

242
00:14:42,541 --> 00:14:43,541
Yeah?

243
00:14:44,125 --> 00:14:47,375
Wait. You're still Jen right now?

244
00:14:47,458 --> 00:14:48,666
Yeah.

245
00:14:49,458 --> 00:14:50,750
And I'm conscious.

246
00:14:51,083 --> 00:14:53,458
This is incredible.
You don't have an alter ego.

247
00:14:53,541 --> 00:14:55,166
You're the only one in there?

248
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:56,875
As far as I can tell.

249
00:14:57,250 --> 00:14:58,666
This is huge, Jen.

250
00:14:58,750 --> 00:14:59,833
I think I'm jealous.

251
00:14:59,916 --> 00:15:01,916
Is that what I'm feeling? I'm feeling...

252
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,833
You don't have
another guy to wrestle with for 10 years.

253
00:15:06,833 --> 00:15:07,833
Cool.

254
00:15:08,708 --> 00:15:09,708
Bruh.

255
00:15:09,791 --> 00:15:14,125
You know, that's about a million dollars'
worth of damage back there, by the way.

256
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:18,750
You really don't feel like there's
another hand on the wheel at all?

257
00:15:19,541 --> 00:15:21,833
No.

258
00:15:22,375 --> 00:15:23,583
It's just me.

259
00:15:23,916 --> 00:15:27,458
The first time, it was so intense I could
barely remember what was happening,

260
00:15:27,541 --> 00:15:31,166
but now it's like it settled in.

261
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:32,958
Hmm. Well,

262
00:15:34,125 --> 00:15:37,583
I guess we can just skip all that, then.

263
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:41,000
Yeah, kinda seems like I'm done here.

264
00:15:41,125 --> 00:15:43,041
Not so fast.

265
00:15:43,583 --> 00:15:47,125
You still can't control
when you transform.

266
00:15:47,208 --> 00:15:49,833
Okay, so how do I turn back into Jen?

267
00:15:49,916 --> 00:15:51,250
How did you do it?

268
00:15:51,333 --> 00:15:54,833
Usually, I fall out of a jet
or I get knocked out by a robot,

269
00:15:54,916 --> 00:15:56,125
and I'd wake up as Banner.

270
00:15:56,208 --> 00:16:00,250
Or Natasha, for a little while,
would tell me a lullaby.

271
00:16:00,583 --> 00:16:02,333
Walk me through how that worked, again.

272
00:16:03,041 --> 00:16:04,875
I don't have a great explanation for it.

273
00:16:04,958 --> 00:16:08,250
Okay, it seems like the common thread,
though, is being unconscious.

274
00:16:08,333 --> 00:16:09,416
Not necessarily.

275
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:12,250
One time, I was stuck
as the other guy for over two years.

276
00:16:13,708 --> 00:16:14,791
That was in outer space.

277
00:16:14,875 --> 00:16:18,458
- No, I can't stay like this for two years.
- I said "one time."

278
00:16:18,916 --> 00:16:20,250
Whoa.

279
00:16:20,708 --> 00:16:23,375
You have so much more
to learn about being a Hulk.

280
00:16:23,458 --> 00:16:27,458
I don't think you have thought through
how dangerous this level of power is.

281
00:16:27,541 --> 00:16:30,041
Do you know the damage you can cause?

282
00:16:30,333 --> 00:16:34,375
I mean, one mistake,
one freak-out is literally life or death.

283
00:16:34,458 --> 00:16:36,125
Okay, I'll be careful.

284
00:16:36,208 --> 00:16:38,291
You can't be emotional.

285
00:16:38,375 --> 00:16:40,083
Forget Hulk rage.

286
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:44,083
Just regular anger means
death and destruction for everything

287
00:16:44,166 --> 00:16:45,250
and everyone around you.

288
00:16:45,333 --> 00:16:48,791
And I'm telling you, when people start
seeing you as a monster,

289
00:16:48,875 --> 00:16:50,333
that never goes away.

290
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:52,750
Fine.

291
00:16:53,541 --> 00:16:57,041
Teach me how to Hulk, please.

292
00:16:58,375 --> 00:17:00,583
Dialectical behavioral therapy.

293
00:17:00,666 --> 00:17:04,375
It allows us to hold two
opposing truths at the same time.

294
00:17:04,458 --> 00:17:08,166
First, we're gonna practice some
mindfulness with a few yoga techniques.

295
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:11,291
I never thought you'd be into
all this mind-body-spirit stuff.

296
00:17:11,375 --> 00:17:16,333
Dialectical behavioral therapy
is an evidence-based psychotherapy.

297
00:17:16,416 --> 00:17:18,250
It's clinical, not spiritual.

298
00:17:18,333 --> 00:17:21,750
Let your thoughts
drift away, relax your neck,

299
00:17:21,833 --> 00:17:23,458
bend your knees if that's comfortable,

300
00:17:23,541 --> 00:17:24,541
hold in your farts.

301
00:17:24,625 --> 00:17:26,125
<i>Namaste,</i> all day.

302
00:17:26,208 --> 00:17:27,625
It's more about presence.

303
00:17:28,208 --> 00:17:30,291
About accepting the situation you're in.

304
00:17:30,375 --> 00:17:32,916
Oh, I thought it was about
getting my butt tight as hell.

305
00:17:33,291 --> 00:17:34,291
Up top.

306
00:17:34,375 --> 00:17:35,416
Gross, Jen. I'm your cousin.

307
00:17:35,541 --> 00:17:36,708
Close your eyes and breathe.

308
00:17:36,791 --> 00:17:37,791
Wow.

309
00:17:37,875 --> 00:17:39,916
I can see that you're not ready for DBT,

310
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,208
so why don't you get some rest,
and we'll change tactics in the morning?

311
00:17:53,375 --> 00:17:54,625
Wow.

312
00:17:54,708 --> 00:17:56,583
Jesus. What the hell, man?

313
00:17:56,666 --> 00:17:58,916
Still in control?
No overwhelming feelings of rage?

314
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,166
No, a normal amount of rage!

315
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:03,500
You do revert back to Jen form
when you sleep.

316
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:05,125
Was the airhorn really necessary?

317
00:18:05,208 --> 00:18:07,291
For comedy, absolutely.

318
00:18:07,375 --> 00:18:10,375
So, you're gonna need
to reinforce all your furniture.

319
00:18:10,458 --> 00:18:14,666
Don't even think about moving to a place
with less than ten-foot ceilings.

320
00:18:15,166 --> 00:18:16,250
Trust me.

321
00:18:21,208 --> 00:18:25,833
You're gonna need two wardrobes,
one for Jen and one for your Hulk body.

322
00:18:26,333 --> 00:18:27,625
Who's your best friend?

323
00:18:28,083 --> 00:18:29,291
Nikki.

324
00:18:29,375 --> 00:18:30,375
Spandex.

325
00:18:30,875 --> 00:18:32,625
Spandex is your best friend.

326
00:18:32,875 --> 00:18:35,750
Boulder toss. Just gonna toss a boulder.
It's not a big deal.

327
00:18:38,375 --> 00:18:40,625
-Me?
-Yeah, just grab a little boulder,

328
00:18:40,708 --> 00:18:42,708
and take it easy on this first one.

329
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:47,541
Yes!

330
00:18:47,625 --> 00:18:48,625
Yeah, yeah.

331
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:51,750
Hi-yah!

332
00:18:53,708 --> 00:18:55,750
-Very good.
-Just trying to show ya how it's done.

333
00:18:55,833 --> 00:18:57,083
-Well, I'm shown.
-Yeah?

334
00:19:02,458 --> 00:19:05,541
Men! Men!

335
00:19:06,041 --> 00:19:08,625
Being a Hulk asks for balance.

336
00:19:15,541 --> 00:19:17,750
Ground pound!

337
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
It's easy.

338
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:28,958
Little punk.

339
00:19:32,083 --> 00:19:33,416
Dick move.

340
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:34,500
Completely.

341
00:19:34,625 --> 00:19:36,583
So, I'm clearly nailing it
at all of these things,

342
00:19:36,666 --> 00:19:38,916
when am I ever going
to use this as a lawyer?

343
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,791
Jen, when you have powers like this,
it's like putting a target on your back

344
00:19:42,875 --> 00:19:44,416
and all the people you care about.

345
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:46,708
Cool. Yet another way my life is ruined.

346
00:19:46,791 --> 00:19:48,375
-Thanks, Bruce.
-All right.

347
00:19:48,458 --> 00:19:51,708
All I've been doin' is showin' you
the downsides of being a Hulk,

348
00:19:51,791 --> 00:19:54,458
but there are a few upsides.

349
00:19:56,291 --> 00:20:00,333
Our bodies metabolize alcohol
at an incredibly fast rate.

350
00:20:00,958 --> 00:20:06,166
Which means that we can drink
so much and not get drunk.

351
00:20:08,875 --> 00:20:10,458
All buzz, no barf.

352
00:20:11,291 --> 00:20:12,541
That's good.

353
00:20:20,458 --> 00:20:23,708
-You built this bar by hand?
-Oh, yeah.

354
00:20:24,291 --> 00:20:26,583
-That's impressive.
-Yeah, me and Tony.

355
00:20:27,083 --> 00:20:31,083
Well, Tony mostly drank, just sat around,
like, complaining about Steve.

356
00:20:31,166 --> 00:20:32,916
Oh, Steve.

357
00:20:34,541 --> 00:20:36,500
It was a good time during a hard time.

358
00:20:39,875 --> 00:20:41,875
To a good time during a hard time.

359
00:20:43,208 --> 00:20:44,458
Drink to that.

360
00:20:54,833 --> 00:20:57,250
Bruce, you failed to mention that

361
00:20:57,333 --> 00:20:59,291
I'd have to deal
with a Hulk-sized hangover.

362
00:20:59,375 --> 00:21:02,291
Ah, I'll have to put it in the binder.

363
00:21:03,333 --> 00:21:04,541
Ow!

364
00:21:05,333 --> 00:21:06,625
I'll see you out there.

365
00:21:13,666 --> 00:21:15,708
Hear the waves breaking.

366
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:18,750
Feel the breaths. No judgment.

367
00:21:25,541 --> 00:21:28,875
So, when do you think I can leave here?

368
00:21:28,958 --> 00:21:31,333
Let's just focus on each day
as they come, Jen.

369
00:21:31,416 --> 00:21:32,958
I mean,

370
00:21:33,583 --> 00:21:35,708
I legitimately do have
a life to get back to.

371
00:21:35,791 --> 00:21:37,708
I know I've been
pushing you through a lot,

372
00:21:38,083 --> 00:21:41,166
but being a superhero is a trial by fire.

373
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:44,000
Bruce, I'm not gonna be a superhero.

374
00:21:45,666 --> 00:21:47,583
What else ya gonna do as a Hulk?

375
00:21:47,708 --> 00:21:51,708
Return to my career that
I have spent years building,

376
00:21:52,291 --> 00:21:55,791
use my law degree that I'm still
paying off a fortune in student loans for.

377
00:21:55,875 --> 00:21:57,250
It's not one or the other, Jen.

378
00:21:57,333 --> 00:22:01,500
I am trying to show you that we can live
between what we want and what is.

379
00:22:01,875 --> 00:22:05,208
But we can't pretend like we aren't
two of the few people on Earth

380
00:22:05,291 --> 00:22:06,750
that can actually protect her.

381
00:22:06,833 --> 00:22:11,000
Which is why we have to make sure
of your ability to tolerate the stress

382
00:22:11,083 --> 00:22:14,791
and regulate your emotions,
especially your anger.

383
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:17,875
Here's the thing, Bruce.
I'm great at controlling my anger.

384
00:22:17,958 --> 00:22:19,583
-Hmm.
-I do it all the time.

385
00:22:20,166 --> 00:22:22,875
When I'm catcalled
in the street,

386
00:22:23,708 --> 00:22:27,458
when incompetent men explain
my own area of expertise to me.

387
00:22:27,541 --> 00:22:30,750
I do it pretty much every day
because if I don't,

388
00:22:30,833 --> 00:22:37,000
I will get called emotional, or difficult,
or might just literally get murdered.

389
00:22:37,083 --> 00:22:42,875
So I'm an expert at controlling my anger
because I do it infinitely more than you.

390
00:22:42,958 --> 00:22:47,500
So all of this just feels like
projecting a lot of shit onto me.

391
00:22:48,666 --> 00:22:49,708
See?

392
00:22:49,833 --> 00:22:51,666
No. I'm doing this.

393
00:22:52,083 --> 00:22:54,291
Okay, this is completely new territory.

394
00:22:56,416 --> 00:22:58,375
I guess I've outgrown your binder, cuz.

395
00:22:58,750 --> 00:23:00,500
Love you, Bruce, but I'm going home.

396
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,125
All right.

397
00:23:02,208 --> 00:23:03,916
Jen, why are you runnin' away?

398
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,500
- Jen.
- I'm gonna borrow the Jeep,

399
00:23:06,583 --> 00:23:09,083
take it back to LA,
and you can pick it up at my place.

400
00:23:09,166 --> 00:23:10,166
Jen, stop.

401
00:23:10,250 --> 00:23:11,916
Just stop and think it
through for a minute.

402
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,333
This is all I've been
thinking about, Bruce.

403
00:23:14,416 --> 00:23:18,291
I did your dialectical behavior therapy,
I can change back and forth,

404
00:23:18,375 --> 00:23:21,041
and I'm happy to now get back to my life.

405
00:23:21,125 --> 00:23:22,625
I know you didn't ask for this,

406
00:23:22,708 --> 00:23:26,166
but whether you like it or not,
you're now a superhero.

407
00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:29,791
And who's gonna protect the world
if it isn't people like us?

408
00:23:29,875 --> 00:23:31,333
Are you quoting a comic right now?

409
00:23:32,416 --> 00:23:36,416
I'm sorry. The idea of being a superhero
is not appealing to me.

410
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:37,500
I'm not you.

411
00:23:37,583 --> 00:23:39,625
And I'm not gonna become you.

412
00:23:39,708 --> 00:23:43,166
I don't need to join some secret
government contractor squad

413
00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:45,958
and have my entire life
taken away from me.

414
00:23:46,041 --> 00:23:48,875
-My life wasn't taken away.
-Really?

415
00:23:48,958 --> 00:23:52,541
Oh, so you didn't wind up alone,
hiding away on some remote beach

416
00:23:52,625 --> 00:23:56,333
with no friends, no relationships,
never seeing your family,

417
00:23:56,416 --> 00:23:59,583
and definitely not dealing
with a decade's worth of trauma?

418
00:23:59,875 --> 00:24:01,791
Why would you want that for me, Bruce?

419
00:24:02,458 --> 00:24:03,875
You're a cautionary tale.

420
00:24:03,958 --> 00:24:06,500
That's the price you have to pay
for keeping the world safe.

421
00:24:06,583 --> 00:24:09,166
It's not wrong that
I am choosing to help people

422
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:11,333
in the way that I've always wanted to.

423
00:24:11,416 --> 00:24:15,291
I spent a lifetime running
from this aspect of myself.

424
00:24:15,375 --> 00:24:18,833
Denying half of your being
is no way to live, trust me.

425
00:24:18,916 --> 00:24:19,916
-Goodbye.
-Okay.

426
00:24:21,166 --> 00:24:23,875
-What do you think you're doing?
-I'm asking you to reconsider.

427
00:24:23,958 --> 00:24:26,791
Done. Yes, I've reconsidered.
I'm still leaving.

428
00:24:26,875 --> 00:24:28,208
Jen, don't you dare.

429
00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:31,250
I'm serious.

430
00:24:31,333 --> 00:24:32,666
You're not the only one!

431
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:35,541
What, you think you can just say
mean things and take off?

432
00:24:35,625 --> 00:24:37,250
Yes!

433
00:24:39,833 --> 00:24:41,625
Jen!

434
00:24:47,458 --> 00:24:48,458
Bruce?

435
00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:55,750
Dick move.

436
00:24:56,625 --> 00:24:57,708
I learned it from you.

437
00:24:57,791 --> 00:25:03,083
See, Jen, you're doing the best you can,
and you can do better.

438
00:25:03,166 --> 00:25:07,125
Enough dialectical behavioral bullshit!

439
00:25:27,583 --> 00:25:30,791
For the record,
I really didn't wanna do this.

440
00:25:36,125 --> 00:25:38,000
Okay, I wanted to do it a little.

441
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:43,625
Why wouldn't you listen to someone
who's been through all of this before?

442
00:25:43,708 --> 00:25:45,333
Because we're different people!

443
00:25:45,416 --> 00:25:47,416
-Lunkhead!
-Dummy!

444
00:25:50,208 --> 00:25:51,708
That's all you got?

445
00:25:52,625 --> 00:25:53,958
Ah!

446
00:26:45,541 --> 00:26:46,541
Uh-oh.

447
00:26:48,125 --> 00:26:50,666
My bar!

448
00:26:51,125 --> 00:26:52,625
Sorry.

449
00:26:53,625 --> 00:26:54,833
You're fixing it.

450
00:26:59,583 --> 00:27:03,166
So, if you wanna go back
to your life as a lawyer, I respect that.

451
00:27:03,750 --> 00:27:04,791
Thanks.

452
00:27:05,375 --> 00:27:06,375
He doesn't mean that.

453
00:27:19,125 --> 00:27:20,708
- Mmm.
- Mmm-hmm.

454
00:27:23,333 --> 00:27:24,833
Hmm? Mmm.

455
00:27:26,708 --> 00:27:28,333
Oh.

456
00:27:28,625 --> 00:27:31,083
Just so you know, I'm the only
other person in the world

457
00:27:31,166 --> 00:27:32,750
that knows what you're going through.

458
00:27:32,833 --> 00:27:33,833
I know.

459
00:27:34,958 --> 00:27:38,750
-So, call me anytime.
-Thank you, Bruce. Thanks for everything.

460
00:27:39,083 --> 00:27:40,083
Aw!

461
00:27:41,041 --> 00:27:43,916
And I'm sorry that I said a bunch
of harsh but very true things.

462
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:48,250
Wow, an apology that still doubles down
on a thing you're apologizing for.

463
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:49,541
That's very lawyerly.

464
00:27:49,625 --> 00:27:52,083
Yeah, I'm a much better lawyer
than I am a Hulk.

465
00:27:52,166 --> 00:27:53,958
Mmm. Now who's smug?

466
00:27:55,625 --> 00:27:56,625
Look.

467
00:27:57,125 --> 00:27:58,166
You change your mind,

468
00:27:58,791 --> 00:28:00,000
door never closes.

469
00:28:00,125 --> 00:28:01,125
Thanks.

470
00:28:01,208 --> 00:28:02,583
See you at the next family dinner.

471
00:28:02,666 --> 00:28:04,125
See ya, fuzzball.

472
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,291
<i>So that's how it all happened.</i>

473
00:28:12,375 --> 00:28:14,416
<i>And no crazy Hulk stuff since.</i>

474
00:28:15,083 --> 00:28:19,291
So, now my family knows,
and Nikki knows, and you know.

475
00:28:19,375 --> 00:28:22,083
Basically, I was right,
and Bruce was wrong,

476
00:28:22,166 --> 00:28:24,375
and I never have to be a Hulk.

477
00:28:24,458 --> 00:28:27,791
Okay. So, now I'm gonna go win this case.

478
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:29,750
Lawyer show.

479
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:34,416
I ask you to look
only at the facts of this case.

480
00:28:34,875 --> 00:28:39,291
You'll see that my client
was well within his right

481
00:28:39,375 --> 00:28:42,083
to protect his business interest.

482
00:28:43,916 --> 00:28:47,791
These accidental deaths
were an unfortunate byproduct

483
00:28:47,875 --> 00:28:49,500
of an ambitious expansion plan.

484
00:28:50,250 --> 00:28:52,500
Did my client know
lives would be endangered?

485
00:28:53,166 --> 00:28:57,083
That is debatable and depends
on your definition of knowing.

486
00:28:57,166 --> 00:28:59,875
Don't screw this up, Walters.

487
00:29:00,583 --> 00:29:02,666
Ms Walters,
your closing argument?

488
00:29:07,166 --> 00:29:08,791
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury...

489
00:29:13,791 --> 00:29:14,791
Oh, my God!

490
00:29:16,083 --> 00:29:17,291
Seal the door!

491
00:29:17,375 --> 00:29:18,375
Don't move.

492
00:29:18,458 --> 00:29:19,833
You need to do your thing.

493
00:29:20,291 --> 00:29:22,583
- Stop resisting.
- Right now in front of everybody?

494
00:29:23,083 --> 00:29:24,333
Yes, yes.

495
00:29:24,458 --> 00:29:25,583
Come on.

496
00:29:25,666 --> 00:29:26,791
Civic duty.

497
00:29:28,125 --> 00:29:29,250
Jen. Come on.

498
00:29:29,375 --> 00:29:31,458
Oh, God, I really like this outfit.

499
00:29:31,541 --> 00:29:32,541
Help! Help!

500
00:29:32,625 --> 00:29:34,750
Jen. Shoes.

501
00:29:34,875 --> 00:29:36,375
- Right. Thank you.
- Okay.

502
00:29:45,541 --> 00:29:46,583
Who the hell are you?

503
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:49,125
Jennifer Walters, attorney at law.

504
00:30:21,416 --> 00:30:23,416
I'm ready to give my closing argument now.

505
00:32:14,666 --> 00:32:16,083
It's just so sad.

506
00:32:16,625 --> 00:32:20,416
Steve Rogers did so much for his country
and he never got to experience sex.

507
00:32:21,958 --> 00:32:23,250
Did you see that ass?

508
00:32:23,333 --> 00:32:27,583
Like, that ass did not
deserve to die a virgin.

509
00:32:27,666 --> 00:32:29,416
It's, like, so sad.

510
00:32:30,125 --> 00:32:32,541
Steve Rogers is not a virgin.

511
00:32:32,625 --> 00:32:38,000
He lost his virginity to a girl
in 1943 on the USO tour.

512
00:32:38,416 --> 00:32:40,583
Yes. I knew it.

513
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:43,500
You're not drunk?

514
00:32:43,625 --> 00:32:45,916
Captain America...
