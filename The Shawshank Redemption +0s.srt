00:27:55,281 --> 00:27:57,658
If they find it, you're gonna lose it.

333
00:27:57,659 --> 00:27:59,868
If they do catch you with it, you don't know me.

334
00:27:59,869 --> 00:28:02,162
Mention my name, we never do business again.

335
00:28:02,163 --> 00:28:06,463
Not for shoelaces or a stick of gum. Now, you got that?

336
00:28:06,793 --> 00:28:08,293
I understand.

337
00:28:08,294 --> 00:28:09,711
Thank you...

338
00:28:09,712 --> 00:28:11,312
Mr. er...?

339
00:28:11,422 --> 00:28:13,622
Red. The name's Red.

340
00:28:13,883 --> 00:28:15,008
Red?

341
00:28:15,009 --> 00:28:17,569
Why do they call you that?

342
00:28:21,432 --> 00:28:24,172
Maybe it's because I'm Irish.

343
00:28:31,484 --> 00:28:34,611
i could see why some of the boys took him for snobby.

344
00:28:34,612 --> 00:28:37,352
He had a quiet way about him.

345
00:28:38,116 --> 00:28:42,356
A walk and a talk that just wasn't normal around here.

346
00:28:42,662 --> 00:28:44,288
He strolled...

347
00:28:44,289 --> 00:28:48,709
like a man in a park, without a care or worry in the world.

348
00:28:48,710 --> 00:28:53,505
Like he had on an invisible coat that would shield him from this place.

349
00:28:53,506 --> 00:28:56,906
Yeah. I think it would be fair to say...

350
00:28:57,677 --> 00:29:00,357
I liked Andy from the start.

351
00:29:01,514 --> 00:29:05,454
Let's go! Some of us have got a schedule to keep.

352
00:29:08,021 --> 00:29:10,581
Move it! Come on. Move it!

353
00:29:13,735 --> 00:29:17,855
Bob, how are you doing? How's the wife treating you?

354
00:29:26,581 --> 00:29:27,881
Easy.

355
00:29:28,124 --> 00:29:30,024
Keep it moving.

356
00:29:33,004 --> 00:29:34,364
Red...

357
00:29:54,776 --> 00:29:58,116
andy was right. i finally got the joke.

358
00:29:59,072 --> 00:30:04,812
It would take a man about 600 years to tunnel under the wall with one of these.

359
00:30:07,914 --> 00:30:09,122
Book?

360
00:30:09,123 --> 00:30:10,723
Not today.

361
00:30:16,339 --> 00:30:18,119
- Book? - No.

362
00:30:20,218 --> 00:30:21,998
Hey, Brooksy.

363
00:30:24,722 --> 00:30:27,042
Delivery for Dufresne.

364
00:30:33,898 --> 00:30:35,198
Book?

365
00:30:42,532 --> 00:30:44,192
Dufresne...

366
00:30:44,742 --> 00:30:46,762
Here's your book.

367
00:30:51,332 --> 00:30:52,752
Thanks.

368
00:30:56,838 --> 00:31:00,132
Dufresne! We're running low on Hexlite.

369
00:31:00,133 --> 00:31:03,113
Get on back and fetch us up some.

370
00:31:39,422 --> 00:31:41,465
If you get this in your eyes, it blinds you.

371
00:31:41,466 --> 00:31:43,246
Honey...hush.

372
00:31:56,272 --> 00:31:58,532
That's it. You fight.

373
00:31:58,775 --> 00:32:01,035
It's better that way.

374
00:32:08,785 --> 00:32:11,703
i wish i could tell you that andy fought the good fight,

375
00:32:11,704 --> 00:32:14,324
and the Sisters let him be.

376
00:32:14,332 --> 00:32:16,416
I wish I could tell you that.

377
00:32:16,417 --> 00:32:19,457
But prison is no fairy-tale world.

378
00:32:20,463 --> 00:32:22,672
He never said who did it.

379
00:32:22,673 --> 00:32:24,633
But we all knew.

380
00:39:05,951 --> 00:39:07,431

[CHUCKLING] 

386
00:41:55,074 --> 00:32:51,580
- I'm sorry to hear that. - I'm not. He was an asshole.

387
00:32:51,581 --> 00:32:53,995
- I'm sorry to hear that. - I'm not. He was an asshole. - I'm sorry to hear that. - I'm not. He was an asshole. Things went on like that for a while. Prison life consists of routine... and then more routine. Every so often, Andy would show up with fresh bruises. The Sisters kept at him. Sometimes he was able to fight 'em off. Sometimes not. And that's how it went for Andy.

388
00:32:53,996 --> 00:32:56,256
That was his routine.

389
00:32:56,624 --> 00:33:00,502
I do believe those first two years were the worst for him.

390
00:33:00,503 --> 00:33:02,643
And I also believe,

391
00:33:02,839 --> 00:33:07,467
if things had gone on that way, this place would have got the best of him.

392
00:33:07,468 --> 00:33:10,388
But then, in the spring of 1949,

393
00:33:10,513 --> 00:33:12,597
the powers that be decided that...

394
00:33:12,598 --> 00:33:16,101
The roof of the license-plate factory needs resurfacing.

395
00:33:16,102 --> 00:33:19,742
I need a dozen volunteers for a week's work.

396
00:33:20,022 --> 00:33:21,742
As you know,

397
00:33:22,233 --> 00:33:26,027
special detail carries with it special privileges.

398
00:33:26,028 --> 00:33:28,468
it was outdoor detail...

399
00:33:29,615 --> 00:33:33,285
..and May is one damn fine month to be working outdoors.

400
00:33:33,286 --> 00:33:34,995
Stay in line there.

401
00:33:34,996 --> 00:33:38,876
More than a hundred men volunteered for the job.

402
00:33:42,295 --> 00:33:44,255
Wallace E Unger.

403
00:33:45,756 --> 00:33:47,596
Ellis Redding.

404
00:33:48,301 --> 00:33:50,561
Wouldn't you know it?

405
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:53,889
Me and some fellows I know were among the names.

406
00:33:53,890 --> 00:33:55,850
andrew dufresne.

407
00:33:56,058 --> 00:33:59,518
it only cost us a pack of smokes per man.

408
00:33:59,687 --> 00:34:02,480
I made my usual 20 per cent, of course.

409
00:34:02,481 --> 00:34:06,151
so, this big-shot lawyer calls me long-distance from texas.

410
00:34:06,152 --> 00:34:07,872
I say, Yeah?

411
00:34:07,945 --> 00:34:11,740
He says, Sorry to inform you, but your brother just died.

412
00:34:11,741 --> 00:34:14,326
Oh, damn, Byron. I'm sorry to hear that.

413
00:34:14,327 --> 00:34:15,785
I'm not. He was an asshole.

414
00:34:15,786 --> 00:34:18,205
Ran off years ago. Figured him for dead, anyway.

415
00:34:18,206 --> 00:34:22,250
So, anyway, this lawyer fella says to me, Your brother died a rich man.

416
00:34:22,251 --> 00:34:25,045
Oil wells and shit. Close to a million bucks.

417
00:34:25,046 --> 00:34:27,006
a million bucks?

418
00:34:27,590 --> 00:34:30,050
Fucking incredible how lucky some assholes get.

419
00:34:30,051 --> 00:34:32,677
Jeez-Louise! Are you gonna see any of that?

420
00:34:32,678 --> 00:34:35,538
35,000. That's what he left me.

421
00:34:35,848 --> 00:34:37,849
- Dollars? - Yeah.

422
00:34:37,850 --> 00:34:41,061
Holy shit! That's great. That's like winning the sweepstakes.

423
00:34:41,062 --> 00:34:42,354
Isn’t it?

424
00:34:42,355 --> 00:34:45,482
Dumb shit. What do you think the government's gonna do to me?

425
00:34:45,483 --> 00:34:48,026
Take a big, wet bite out of my ass, is what.

426
00:34:48,027 --> 00:34:51,367
Poor Byron! Terrible fucking luck, huh?

427
00:34:52,281 --> 00:34:54,061
crying shame.

428
00:34:55,034 --> 00:34:56,785
Some people really got it awful!

429
00:34:56,786 --> 00:34:58,411
Andy, are you nuts?

430
00:34:58,412 --> 00:35:00,538
Keep your eyes on your mop, man. Andy!

431
00:35:00,539 --> 00:35:03,667
well, you'll pay some tax, but you'll still end up...

432
00:35:03,668 --> 00:35:06,586
Oh, yeah, yeah. Maybe enough to buy a new car. Then what?

433
00:35:06,587 --> 00:35:09,047
I've got to pay tax on the car.

434
00:35:09,048 --> 00:35:13,009
Repair, maintenance, goddamn kids pestering me to take them for a ride...

435
00:35:13,010 --> 00:35:17,013
And at the end of the year, you figure the tax wrong, you pay them out of your own pocket.

436
00:35:17,014 --> 00:35:19,266
I tell you...Uncle Sam!

437
00:35:19,267 --> 00:35:23,103
He puts his hand in your shirt and squeezes your tit till it's purple.

438
00:35:23,104 --> 00:35:25,897
- Andy! Andy! - What's he doing?

439
00:35:25,898 --> 00:35:28,316
- Getting himself killed. - Keep tarring.

440
00:35:28,317 --> 00:35:30,457
some brother! shit.

441
00:35:31,487 --> 00:35:32,727
Hey!

442
00:35:35,866 --> 00:35:37,646
Mr. Hadley...

443
00:35:38,077 --> 00:35:40,457
do you trust your wife?

444
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:42,914
Oh, that's funny.

445
00:35:42,915 --> 00:35:45,875
You're gonna look funnier sucking my dick with no teeth.

446
00:35:45,876 --> 00:35:50,422
I mean, do you think she'd go behind your back, try to hamstring you?

447
00:35:50,423 --> 00:35:52,382
That's it. Step aside, Mert.

448
00:35:52,383 --> 00:35:53,967
This fucker's having an accident.

449
00:35:53,968 --> 00:35:55,218
He's gonna push him off.

450
00:35:55,219 --> 00:35:59,431
Cos if you do trust her, there's no reason you can't keep that 35,000.

451
00:35:59,432 --> 00:36:01,391
- What did you say? - 35,000.

452
00:36:01,392 --> 00:36:03,101
- 35,000? - All of it.

453
00:36:03,102 --> 00:36:05,520
- All of it? - Every penny.

454
00:36:05,521 --> 00:36:07,439
You'd better start making sense.

455
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:09,858
If you want to keep the money, give it to your wife.

456
00:36:09,859 --> 00:36:14,070
The IRS allows a one-time-only gift to your spouse for up to $60,000.

457
00:36:14,071 --> 00:36:15,613
Bullshit! Tax-free?

458
00:36:15,614 --> 00:36:18,867
Tax-free. The IRS can't touch one cent.

459
00:36:18,868 --> 00:36:21,536
You're the smart banker what killed his wife.

460
00:36:21,537 --> 00:36:25,165
Why should I believe a smart banker like you? So I can end up in here with you?

461
00:36:25,166 --> 00:36:26,750
It's legal. Ask the IRS.

462
00:36:26,751 --> 00:36:30,045
They'll say the same thing. But I feel stupid telling you this.

463
00:36:30,046 --> 00:36:32,422
I'm sure you would have investigated the matter.

464
00:36:32,423 --> 00:36:36,593
Yeah, I don't need no banker to tell me where the bears shit in the buckwheat.

465
00:36:36,594 --> 00:36:39,721
Of course not, but you do need someone to set up the tax-free gift.

466
00:36:39,722 --> 00:36:41,681
It'll cost you. A lawyer.

467
00:36:41,682 --> 00:36:44,100
A bunch of ball-washing bastards.

468
00:36:44,101 --> 00:36:47,937
I suppose I could set it up for you. That would save you some money.

469
00:36:47,938 --> 00:36:50,398
If you get the forms, I'll prepare them for you.

470
00:36:50,399 --> 00:36:52,719
Nearly free of charge.

471
00:36:53,361 --> 00:36:56,821
I'd only ask three beers apiece for each of my co-workers.

472
00:36:56,822 --> 00:36:59,324
co-workers! get him! that's rich, ain't it?

473
00:36:59,325 --> 00:37:02,869
I think a man working outdoors feels more like a man

474
00:37:02,870 --> 00:37:04,704
if he can have a bottle of suds.

475
00:37:04,705 --> 00:37:07,445
That's only my opinion...sir.

476
00:37:11,170 --> 00:37:12,796
What are you jimmies staring at?

477
00:37:12,797 --> 00:37:13,880
Back to work!

478
00:37:13,881 --> 00:37:15,781
let's go. work.

479
00:37:24,225 --> 00:37:29,785
and that's how it came to pass... that on the second-to-last day of the job,

480
00:37:29,814 --> 00:37:34,567
the convict crew that tarred the plate-factory roof in the spring of '49...

481
00:37:34,568 --> 00:37:37,862
wound up sitting in a row at ten o'clock in the morning,

482
00:37:37,863 --> 00:37:41,263
drinking icy-cold, Bohemia-style beer...

483
00:37:41,826 --> 00:37:47,122
courtesy of the hardest screw that ever walked a turn at Shawshank State Prison.

484
00:37:47,123 --> 00:37:50,103
Drink up while it's cold, ladies.

485
00:37:50,584 --> 00:37:54,764
The colossal prick even managed to sound magnanimous.

486
00:37:56,507 --> 00:38:01,219
We sat and drank with the sun on our shoulders, and felt like free men.

487
00:38:01,220 --> 00:38:04,806
Hell, we could have been tarring the roof of one of our own houses.

488
00:38:04,807 --> 00:38:07,847
We were the lords of all creation.

489
00:38:08,185 --> 00:38:12,605
As for Andy, he spent that break hunkered in the shade...

490
00:38:12,815 --> 00:38:15,608
a strange little smile on his face,

491
00:38:15,609 --> 00:38:18,229
watching us drink his beer.

492
00:38:24,452 --> 00:38:25,812
Hey...

493
00:38:26,078 --> 00:38:27,454
Want a cold one, Andy?

494
00:38:27,455 --> 00:38:29,115
No, thanks.

495
00:38:29,206 --> 00:38:31,346
I gave up drinking.

496
00:38:34,837 --> 00:38:38,089
you could argue he'd done it to curry favor with the guards.

497
00:38:38,090 --> 00:38:41,610
Or maybe make a few friends among us cons.

498
00:38:43,179 --> 00:38:47,059
Me, I think he did it just to feel normal again.

499
00:38:47,725 --> 00:38:50,285
If only for a short while.

500
00:38:52,688 --> 00:38:54,168
king me.

501
00:38:55,107 --> 00:38:57,609
Chess. Now, there's a game of kings.

502
00:38:57,610 --> 00:39:00,236

678
00:53:09,419 --> 00:53:11,003
I don't know,

679
00:53:11,004 --> 00:53:14,340
but it'll be nice to have some company down here for a change.

680
00:53:14,341 --> 00:53:15,881
dufresne!

681
00:53:25,727 --> 00:53:28,347
That's him. That's the one.

682
00:53:35,362 --> 00:53:36,737
(Nervously) I'm Dekins.

683
00:53:36,738 --> 00:53:38,398
i was er...

684
00:53:39,282 --> 00:53:45,082
thinking about maybe setting up some kind of trust fund for my kids' educations.

685
00:53:45,622 --> 00:53:46,922
Oh...

686
00:53:47,165 --> 00:53:48,525
I see.

687
00:53:50,293 --> 00:53:52,013
Well, erm...

688
00:53:53,546 --> 00:53:55,172
..why don't we have a seat,

689
00:53:55,173 --> 00:53:57,193
and talk it over?

690
00:53:59,803 --> 00:54:03,803
Brooks, do you have a piece of paper and a pencil?

691
00:54:14,192 --> 00:54:15,612
Thanks.

692
00:54:15,985 --> 00:54:17,285
So...

693
00:54:18,905 --> 00:54:20,685
Mr. Dekins...

694
00:54:21,491 --> 00:54:26,036
And then Andy says to Mr. Dekins, Do you want your sons to go to Harvard,

695
00:54:26,037 --> 00:54:28,247
- or Yale? - He didn't say that?

696
00:54:28,248 --> 00:54:30,988
As God is my witness, he did!

697
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:34,461
Dekins just blinked for a second. Then he laughed himself silly.

698
00:54:34,462 --> 00:54:36,422
And afterwards he shook Andy's hand.

699
00:54:36,423 --> 00:54:37,843
My ass!

700
00:54:37,882 --> 00:54:39,174
(Laughs) Shook his hand.

701
00:54:39,175 --> 00:54:42,035
hell, i...i near soiled myself!

702
00:54:42,220 --> 00:54:47,933
All Andy needed was a suit and a tie and a little jiggly hula girl on his desk,

703
00:54:47,934 --> 00:54:49,560
Mr. Dufresne, if you please!

704
00:54:49,561 --> 00:54:52,181
Making a few friends, Andy?

705
00:54:52,355 --> 00:54:54,398
I wouldn't say friends.

706
00:54:54,399 --> 00:54:58,485
I'm a convicted murderer who provides sound financial planning.

707
00:54:58,486 --> 00:55:00,904
It's a wonderful pet to have.

708
00:55:00,905 --> 00:55:02,906
Got you out of the laundry, though.

709
00:55:02,907 --> 00:55:05,200
Well, it might do more than that.

710
00:55:05,201 --> 00:55:08,287
How about expanding the library? Get some new books in there.

711
00:55:08,288 --> 00:55:11,081
If you're gonna ask for something, ask for a pool table.

712
00:55:11,082 --> 00:55:13,625
- Right. - How do you expect to do that?

713
00:55:13,626 --> 00:55:18,166
I mean, get new books in here, Mr. Dufresne, if you please?

714
00:55:18,965 --> 00:55:21,465
(Laughter) [MEN CHUCKLING] Ask the Warden for funds.

715
00:55:22,135 --> 00:55:25,512
Son, son. Six wardens have been through here in my tenure,

716
00:55:25,513 --> 00:55:29,224
and I've learned one immutable, universal truth.

717
00:55:29,225 --> 00:55:30,934
Not one of them born...

718
00:55:30,935 --> 00:55:35,981
whose asshole wouldn't pucker up tighter than a snare drum when you asked them for funds.

719
00:55:35,982 --> 00:55:38,358
The budget's stretched thin, as it is.

720
00:55:38,359 --> 00:55:39,693
I see.

721
00:55:39,694 --> 00:55:43,322
Perhaps I could write to the State Senate and request funds from them.

722
00:55:43,323 --> 00:55:47,784
As far as they're concerned, there's only three ways to spend money when it comes to prisons:

723
00:55:47,785 --> 00:55:49,953
more walls, more bars and more guards.

724
00:55:49,954 --> 00:55:54,458
Still, I'd like to try, with your permission. A letter a week. They can't ignore me forever.

725
00:55:54,459 --> 00:55:55,999
Sure can.

726
00:56:18,106 --> 00:56:24,488
He's a friend of yours, and Brooks is a reasonable man. But you write your letters, if it makes you happy. I'll even mail them for you. How's that? so, andy started writing a letter a week, just like he said. And, just like Norton said, Andy got no answers.

727
00:56:24,489 --> 00:56:29,989
The following April, Andy did tax returns for half the guards at Shawshank.

728
00:56:30,078 --> 00:56:33,247
The year after that, he did them all...

729
00:56:33,248 --> 00:56:35,628
including the Warden's.

730
00:56:36,709 --> 00:56:40,546
The year after that, they rescheduled the start of the intramural season

731
00:56:40,547 --> 00:56:43,227
to coincide with tax season.

732
00:56:44,926 --> 00:56:49,221
The guards on the opposing teams all remembered to bring their W-2s.

733
00:56:49,222 --> 00:56:53,433
So, Moresby Prison issued you your gun, but you had to pay for it?

734
00:56:53,434 --> 00:56:55,269
Damn right. The holster, too.

735
00:56:55,270 --> 00:56:56,603
That's tax-deductible.

736
00:56:56,604 --> 00:56:57,854
You can write that off.

737
00:56:57,855 --> 00:57:01,275
yes, sir. andy was a regular cottage industry.

738
00:57:01,276 --> 00:57:04,403
In fact, it got so busy at tax time...

739
00:57:04,404 --> 00:57:06,530
he was allowed a staff.

740
00:57:06,531 --> 00:57:09,074
Hey, Red, can you hand me a stack of 1040s?

741
00:57:09,075 --> 00:57:11,827
It got me out of the wood shop a month out of the year,

742
00:57:11,828 --> 00:57:14,268
and that was fine by me.

743
00:57:26,467 --> 00:57:28,187
(Men shouting) 

744
00:57:33,623 --> 00:57:34,891
Knock it off. And still...he kept sending those letters. Red, Andy. It's Brooks. watch the door. Please, Brooks. - Just calm the fuck down. - Stay back! - Stay back! - What the hell's going on?

745
00:57:34,892 --> 00:57:38,061
You tell me. One second he's fine. Then out comes the knife.

746
00:57:38,062 --> 00:57:40,606
Brooks, we can talk about this. Right?

747
00:57:40,607 --> 00:57:42,816
Nothing to talk about, goddamn it!

748
00:57:42,817 --> 00:57:44,610
I'm gonna cut his fucking throat.

749
00:57:44,611 --> 00:57:46,570
Heywood? Wait, what's he done to you?

750
00:57:46,571 --> 00:57:48,771
It's what they done!

751
00:57:48,781 --> 00:57:50,282
I...I got no choice...

752
00:57:50,283 --> 00:57:53,035
You're not gonna hurt him. Even Heywood knows that.

753
00:57:53,036 --> 00:57:55,746
- Right, Heywood? - I...I know that, sure.

754
00:57:55,747 --> 00:57:59,249
You won't hurt him, because he's a friend, and you're a reasonable man.

755
00:57:59,250 --> 00:58:00,626
That's right. Right, guys?

756
00:58:00,627 --> 00:58:04,087
- Yes. - So, put the knife down. Brooks, look at me.

757
00:58:04,088 --> 00:58:06,228
Put the knife down.

I just don't understand what happened in there. That's all.

768

773
00:59:08,152 --> 00:59:09,872
He's just...

774
00:59:11,906 --> 00:59:14,586
He's just institutionalized.

Institutionalized, my ass.

776
00:59:16,828 --> 00:59:20,888
The man's been in here 50 years, Heywood. 50 years.

777
00:59:21,207 --> 00:59:22,999
This is all he knows.

778
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:25,502
In here, he's an important man.

779
00:59:25,503 --> 00:59:27,045
He's an educated man.

780
00:59:27,046 --> 00:59:29,366

Just a used-up con with arthritis in both hands.

Dear Mr. Dufresne...

854
01:06:16,288 --> 01:06:18,373
In response to your repeated enquiries,

855
01:06:18,374 --> 01:06:23,169
the State has allocated the enclosed funds for your library project.

856
01:06:23,170 --> 01:06:25,370
This is 200 dollars.

857
01:06:25,589 --> 01:06:29,592
In addition, the Library District has generously responded

858
01:06:29,593 --> 01:06:32,387
with a charitable donation of used books and sundries.

859
01:06:32,388 --> 01:06:34,556
We trust this will fill your needs.

860
01:06:34,557 --> 01:06:38,768
We now consider the matter closed. Please stop sending us letters.

Let me tell you something, my friend.

929
01:12:36,001 --> 01:12:38,561
Hope is a dangerous thing.

930
01:12:39,546 --> 01:12:42,226

01:19:13,648 --> 01:19:17,693
Ned, we're providing a valuable community service here.

1022
01:19:17,694 --> 01:19:20,029
Well, that's fine for the papers

1023
01:19:20,030 --> 01:19:21,614

Sam, we go back a long way.

1026
01:19:25,952 --> 01:19:28,370
I need this new highway contract.

1027
01:19:28,371 --> 01:19:30,664
I don't get it, and I go under.

1028
01:19:30,665 --> 01:19:32,505
That's a fact.

1029

01:19:37,088 --> 01:19:39,588
and you think about that.

1032
01:19:46,473 --> 01:19:49,475
Ned, I wouldn't worry too much about this contract.

1033
01:19:49,476 --> 01:19:53,896
It seems to me I already got my boys committed elsewhere.

There's a river of dirty money running through this place.

1050
01:21:21,109 --> 01:21:24,445
But the problem with having all that money is you'll have to explain

1051
01:21:24,446 --> 01:21:27,114
- where it came from. - That's where I come in.

That's where the filtering process starts.

1064

1187
01:29:43,569 --> 01:29:44,989
Murder.

1188
01:29:46,197 --> 01:29:48,217
The hell you say!

1189
01:29:50,076 --> 01:29:53,411
You wouldn't think it to look at the guy.

1190
01:29:53,412 --> 01:29:55,956
He caught his wife in bed with some golf pro.

1191
01:29:55,957 --> 01:29:58,217
He greased them both.

1192
01:30:05,925 --> 01:30:07,225
What?

1193
01:30:07,885 --> 01:30:10,145
About four years ago,

1194
01:30:10,346 --> 01:30:14,046
I was in Thomaston on a two-to-three stretch.

1195
01:30:14,684 --> 01:30:18,444
I stole a car. It was a dumb-fuck thing to do.

1196
01:30:19,063 --> 01:30:21,189
About six months left to go,

1197
01:30:21,190 --> 01:30:23,316
I get a new cellmate in.

1198
01:30:23,317 --> 01:30:25,037
Elmo Blatch.

1199
01:30:26,237 --> 01:30:27,821
Big, twitchy fucker.

1200
01:30:27,822 --> 01:30:30,198
Kind of roomie you pray you don't get.

1201
01:30:30,199 --> 01:30:32,325
You know what I'm saying?

1202
01:30:32,326 --> 01:30:34,452
Six-to-twelve, armed burglary.

1203
01:30:34,453 --> 01:30:37,673
He said he'd pulled hundreds of jobs.

1204
01:30:37,748 --> 01:30:39,708
Hard to believe, high-strung as he was.

1205
01:30:39,709 --> 01:30:43,837
You'd cut a loud fart, he'd jump three feet in the air.

1206
01:30:43,838 --> 01:30:46,338
Talked all the time, too.

1207
01:30:59,236 --> 01:31:00,937
- Solitary. A month. - Yes, sir. That's the other thing. He never shut up. Places he'd been in, jobs he'd pulled, women he'd fucked. Even people he'd killed. People who gave him shit.

1208
01:31:00,938 --> 01:31:03,064
That's how he put it.

1209
01:31:03,065 --> 01:31:04,365
So...

1210
01:31:04,692 --> 01:31:07,072
one night, like a joke,

1211
01:31:07,820 --> 01:31:11,197
I say to him, I say, Yeah, Elmo, who did you kill?

1212
01:31:11,198 --> 01:31:12,978
So he says...

1213
01:31:13,075 --> 01:31:17,675
I got me this job one time bussing tables at a country club.

1214
01:31:17,830 --> 01:31:22,130
So I could case all these big rich pricks that come in.

1215
01:31:23,836 --> 01:31:26,216
So I pick out this guy,

1216
01:31:26,881 --> 01:31:29,861
go in one night and do his place.

1217
01:31:31,636 --> 01:31:33,356
He wakes up.

1218
01:31:44,858 --> 01:31:47,275
How long has he been here now? He gives me shit. So I killed him. Him and this tasty bitch he was with. That's the best part.

1219
01:31:47,276 --> 01:31:50,570
She's fucking this prick, see, this golf pro.

1220
01:31:50,571 --> 01:31:53,698
But she's married to some other guy.

1221
01:31:53,699 --> 01:31:55,899
Some hotshot banker.

1222
01:31:57,578 --> 01:32:00,678
And he's the one they pinned it on.

1223
01:32:10,800 --> 01:32:15,220
I have to say that's the most amazing story I ever heard.

1224
01:32:16,263 --> 01:32:19,224
What amazes me most is you were taken in by it.

1225
01:32:19,225 --> 01:32:20,465
Sir?

1226
01:32:20,935 --> 01:32:22,355
Well...

1227
01:32:22,687 --> 01:32:26,147
it's obvious this fella Williams is impressed with you.

1228
01:32:26,148 --> 01:32:28,316
He hears your tale of woe

1229
01:32:28,317 --> 01:32:31,319
and quite naturally wants to cheer you up.

1230
01:32:31,320 --> 01:32:33,446
He's young, not terribly bright.

1231
01:32:33,447 --> 01:32:38,107
Not surprising he wouldn't know what a state he'd put you in.

1232
01:32:50,573 --> 01:32:51,548
Warden? Sir, he's telling the truth. Well, let's say, for the moment, this Blatch does exist. You think he'd just fall to his knees and cry, Yes, I did it! I confess! And by the way, add a life term to my sentence?

1233
01:32:51,549 --> 01:32:54,801
That doesn't matter. With Tommy's testimony, I can get a new trial.

1234
01:32:54,802 --> 01:32:58,096
That's assuming Blatch is even still there.

1235
01:32:58,097 --> 01:33:00,223
The chances are he'd be released by now.

1236
01:33:00,224 --> 01:33:02,892
They'd have his last address, names of relatives.

1237
01:33:02,893 --> 01:33:05,693
There's a chance, isn't there?

1238
01:33:07,106 --> 01:33:09,065
How can you be so obtuse?

1239
01:33:09,066 --> 01:33:10,366

1240
01:33:12,069 --> 01:33:13,987
What did you call me?

1241
01:33:13,988 --> 01:33:15,905
Obtuse. Is it deliberate?

1247
01:33:31,046 --> 01:33:37,626
I would never mention what goes on in here. I'd be as indictable as you for laundering money.

- Yes, sir. - What's the matter with you?

1254
01:33:52,067 --> 01:33:55,320
- Get him out of here. - This is my chance to get out! Don't you see?

01:33:55,321 --> 01:33:57,405
It's my life! Don't you understand?

Oh, bullshit.

You didn't pull the trigger and you certainly didn't convict him.

01:34:12,630 --> 01:34:15,089
Red, are you saying that Andy is innocent?

1264
01:34:15,090 --> 01:34:17,342
I mean, for real innocent?

01:34:17,343 --> 01:34:19,423

and two or three marbles rolling around upstairs, they'll let me out.

1355
01:43:09,541 --> 01:43:11,981
I tell you where I'd go.

1356
01:43:12,836 --> 01:43:14,545
Zihuatanejo.

1357
01:43:14,546 --> 01:43:16,146
Zi...what?

1358
01:43:16,548 --> 01:43:18,268
Zihuatanejo.

1359
01:43:18,675 --> 01:43:20,575
It's in Mexico.

1360
01:43:22,554 --> 01:43:25,714
A little place on the Pacific Ocean.

1361
01:43:26,016 --> 01:43:28,476
You know what the Mexicans say about the Pacific?

1362
01:43:28,477 --> 01:43:29,657
No.

1363
01:43:30,020 --> 01:43:32,580
They say it has no memory.

1364
01:43:34,566 --> 01:43:38,446
That's where I want to live the rest of my life.

1365
01:43:38,695 --> 01:43:41,375
A warm place with no memory.

1366
01:43:44,076 --> 01:43:46,456
Open up a little hotel,

1367
01:43:48,205 --> 01:43:50,164
right on the beach.

1368
01:43:50,165 --> 01:43:52,291
Buy some worthless old boat,

1369
01:43:52,292 --> 01:43:54,132
fix it up new.

1370
01:43:57,339 --> 01:43:58,631
Take my guests out.

1371
01:43:58,632 --> 01:44:00,592
Charter fishing.

1372
01:44:09,893 --> 01:44:14,973
In a place like that, I could use a man who knows how to get things.

1373
01:44:20,195 --> 01:44:24,255
I don't think I could make it on the outside, Andy.

1374
01:44:29,663 --> 01:44:32,703
I've been in here most of my life.

1375
01:44:33,250 --> 01:44:35,126
I'm an institutional man now.

1376
01:44:35,127 --> 01:44:37,387
Just like Brooks was.

1377
01:44:38,630 --> 01:44:40,965
Well, you underestimate yourself.

1378
01:44:40,966 --> 01:44:42,986
I don't think so.

1379
01:44:45,679 --> 01:44:49,974
I mean...in here, I'm the guy who can get things for you, sure.

1380
01:44:49,975 --> 01:44:53,735
But outside, all you need is the Yellow Pages.

1381
01:44:53,979 --> 01:44:57,499
Hell, I wouldn't even know where to begin.

1382
01:44:58,483 --> 01:45:00,563
The Pacific Ocean?

1383
01:45:00,902 --> 01:45:02,202
Shit.

1384
01:45:03,029 --> 01:45:06,282
- About scare me to death, something that big. - Not me.

1385
01:45:06,283 --> 01:45:10,403
I didn't shoot my wife and I didn't shoot her lover.

1386
01:45:11,663 --> 01:45:15,374
Whatever mistakes I've made, I've paid for them and then some.

1387
01:45:15,375 --> 01:45:17,695
That hotel, that boat.

1388
01:45:19,129 --> 01:45:22,349
I don't think that's too much to ask.

1389
01:45:25,927 --> 01:45:28,888
I don't think you ought to be doing this to yourself, Andy.

1390
01:45:28,889 --> 01:45:31,015
These are just shitty pipe dreams.

1391
01:45:31,016 --> 01:45:34,059
I mean, Mexico is way the hell down there and you're in here.

1392
01:45:34,060 --> 01:45:36,187
And that's the way it is.

1393
01:45:36,188 --> 01:45:39,228
Yeah, right. That's the way it is.

1394
01:45:40,567 --> 01:45:43,487
It's down there and I'm in here.

1395
01:45:45,363 --> 01:45:49,303
I guess it comes down to a simple choice, really.

1396
01:45:50,994 --> 01:45:52,894
Get busy living

1397
01:45:53,121 --> 01:45:55,201
or get busy dying.

1398
01:45:59,836 --> 01:46:01,136
Andy.

1399
01:46:04,382 --> 01:46:05,622
Red.

1400
01:46:07,511 --> 01:46:10,012
If you ever get out of here, do me a favor.

1401
01:46:10,013 --> 01:46:11,673
Sure, Andy.

1402
01:46:11,932 --> 01:46:13,472
Anything.

1403
01:46:14,351 --> 01:46:19,191
There's a big hayfield up near Buxton. You know where Buxton is?

1404
01:46:19,814 --> 01:46:23,692
- Well, just... There's a lot of hayfields up there. - One in particular.

1405
01:46:23,693 --> 01:46:25,819
It's got a long rock wall

1406
01:46:25,820 --> 01:46:27,821
with a big oak tree at the north end.

1407
01:46:27,822 --> 01:46:31,642
It's like something out of a Robert Frost poem.

1408
01:46:31,910 --> 01:46:35,250
It's where I asked my wife to marry me.

1409
01:46:35,830 --> 01:46:40,190
We went there for a picnic and made love under that oak.

1410
01:46:41,127 --> 01:46:43,627
I asked and she said yes.

1411
01:46:47,342 --> 01:46:49,302
Promise me, Red,

1412
01:46:49,469 --> 01:46:51,554
if you ever get out,

1413
01:46:51,555 --> 01:46:53,455
find that spot.

1414
01:46:54,641 --> 01:47:00,187
At the base of that wall, you'll find a rock that has no earthly business in a Maine hayfield.

1415
01:47:00,188 --> 01:47:03,168
A piece of black, volcanic glass.

1416
01:47:05,860 --> 01:47:08,737
There's something buried under it I want you to have.

1417
01:47:08,738 --> 01:47:10,398
What, Andy?

1418
01:47:10,824 --> 01:47:13,384
What's buried under there?

1419
01:47:14,703 --> 01:47:17,623
You'll have to pry it up to see.

1420
01:47:23,420 --> 01:47:26,460
No, I'm telling you, the guy is...

1421
01:47:26,548 --> 01:47:28,716
He's talking funnier.

1422
01:47:28,717 --> 01:47:32,177
- I'm really worried about him. - We ought to keep an eye on him.

1423
01:47:32,178 --> 01:47:37,308
That's fine during the day, but at night he's got that cell all to himself.

1424
01:47:37,309 --> 01:47:38,849
Oh, Lord.

1425
01:47:38,852 --> 01:47:40,152
What?

1426
01:47:42,564 --> 01:47:44,982
Andy come down to the loading dock today.

1427
01:47:44,983 --> 01:47:48,563
- He asked me for a length of rope. - Rope?

1428
01:47:48,570 --> 01:47:50,410
Six feet long.

1429
01:47:50,488 --> 01:47:52,031
And you gave it to him?

1430
01:47:52,032 --> 01:47:54,652
Sure I did. Why wouldn't I?

1431
01:47:54,701 --> 01:47:56,493
Jesus, Heywood.

1432
01:47:56,494 --> 01:47:58,829
Hey, how the hell was I supposed to know?

1433
01:47:58,830 --> 01:48:00,831
Remember Brooks Hatlen?

1434
01:48:00,832 --> 01:48:02,012
No.

1435
01:48:19,682 --> 01:48:26,682
And that cupcake on the wall. Let's ask her. And that cupcake on the wall. Let's ask her. Andy would never do that. Never. I don't know. Every man has his breaking point. Lickety-split. - I want to get home. - Just about finished, sir.

1436
01:48:37,410 --> 01:48:39,790
Three deposits tonight.

1437
01:48:47,879 --> 01:48:49,963
Get my stuff down to the laundry.

1438
01:48:49,964 --> 01:48:53,509
And shine my shoes. I want 'em looking like mirrors.

1439
01:48:53,510 --> 01:48:55,050
Yes, sir.

1440
01:49:00,183 --> 01:49:01,934
It's good having you back, Andy.

1441
01:49:01,935 --> 01:49:05,215
The place wasn't the same without you.

i've had some long nights in stir.

1447
01:50:28,563 --> 01:50:31,356
Alone in the dark with nothing but your thoughts,

01:50:31,357 --> 01:50:34,217
(Thunder rumbles) time can draw out like a blade.

1449

That was the longest night of my life.

(Gate buzzer) [HORN BUZZING] 

1451

- Tier 3 North. Clear. - Man missing on Tier 2.

- Cell 245. - Dufresne.

1456
01:51:14,400 --> 01:51:18,700
Get your ass out here, boy. You're holding up the show.

1457
01:51:19,823 --> 01:51:24,483
Don't make me come down there. I'll thump your skull for you.

1458
01:51:31,459 --> 01:51:34,920
Damn it, Dufresne, you're putting me behind! I got a schedule to keep.

1459
01:51:34,921 --> 01:51:38,090
You'd better be sick or dead in there, I shit you not!

1460
01:51:38,091 --> 01:51:39,811
You hear me?

1461
01:51:46,432 --> 01:51:48,392
Oh, my holy God.

- Start with that friend of his. - Who?

1465
01:52:10,373 --> 01:52:11,613
Him!

Open 237.

1467
01:52:18,590 --> 01:52:20,799
What do you mean, he just wasn't here?

1468
01:52:20,800 --> 01:52:22,426
Don't say that to me, Haig.

1469
01:52:22,427 --> 01:52:24,761
Don't say that to me again.

1470
01:52:24,762 --> 01:52:25,929
But, sir, he wasn't.

1471

I can see that, Haig!

1472
01:52:28,182 --> 01:52:29,975
You think I'm blind?

01:52:29,976 --> 01:52:33,186
Is that what you're saying? Am I blind, Haig?

1474

No, sir.

01:52:34,272 --> 01:52:36,172
What about you?

- Tell me what this is. - Last night's count.

Dufresne.

I see you two all the time. You're thick as thieves, you are.

No, sir, Warden.

Not a word.

Maybe she knows. What say there, Fuzzy Britches? Feel like talking?

Ah...

1497
01:53:47,136 --> 01:53:48,679
I guess not.

1498
01:53:48,680 --> 01:53:51,600
Why should she be any different?

1499
01:53:51,641 --> 01:53:53,901
This is a conspiracy.

1500
01:53:54,185 --> 01:53:56,385
That's what this is.

Andy Dufresne escaped

1509
01:54:44,360 --> 01:54:46,680
from Shawshank Prison.

1510
01:54:48,114 --> 01:54:50,949
All they found of him was a muddy set of prison clothes,

1511
01:54:50,950 --> 01:54:52,730
a bar of soap

1512
01:54:53,077 --> 01:54:57,317
and an old rock hammer damn near worn down to the nub.

1513
01:55:01,836 --> 01:55:06,757
I remember thinking it would take a man 600 years to tunnel through the wall with it.

Oh, Andy loved geology.

1516
01:55:31,157 --> 01:55:34,743
I imagine it appealed to his meticulous nature.

Geology is the study of pressure and time.

That's all it takes, really.

That's where Andy crossed. Pressure... and time. That and a big goddamn poster. Like I said, in prison, a man will do most anything to keep his mind occupied.

1523
01:56:05,108 --> 01:56:10,362

01:56:19,455 --> 01:56:22,495

1528

1531
01:56:58,786 --> 01:57:02,306
Buffed those shoes to a high mirror shine.

1532
01:57:05,877 --> 01:57:08,003
The guard simply didn't notice.

1533
01:57:08,004 --> 01:57:09,844
Neither did I.

1534
01:57:10,131 --> 01:57:15,031
I mean, seriously, how often do you really look at a man's shoes?

1536

The next morning, right about the time Raquel was spilling her little secret,

1546
02:00:41,634 --> 02:00:44,854
a man nobody ever laid eyes on before

1547
02:00:45,137 --> 02:00:47,639
strode into the Maine National Bank.

1548
02:00:47,640 --> 02:00:49,720
Until that moment,

1549
02:00:49,767 --> 02:00:51,726
he didn't exist,

1550
02:00:51,727 --> 02:00:53,144

02:00:53,145 --> 02:00:54,270
May I help you?

1552
02:00:54,271 --> 02:00:56,398
he had all the proper id,

1553

driver's license, birth certificate, social security card.

1554
02:01:00,111 --> 02:01:03,391
And the signature was a spot-on match.

1555
02:01:03,489 --> 02:01:06,616
I must say, I'm sorry to be losing your business.

1556
02:01:06,617 --> 02:01:08,701
I hope you'll enjoy living abroad.

But I hear Byron Hadley started sobbing like a little girl when they took him away.

1694
02:16:58,109 --> 02:17:02,649

I think it's the excitement only a free man can feel.

1699
02:17:19,255 --> 02:17:22,049
A free man at the start of a long journey

1700
02:17:22,050 --> 02:17:24,850
whose conclusion is uncertain.

1701
02:17:27,847 --> 02:17:31,187
I hope I can make it across the border.

1702
02:17:31,893 --> 02:17:35,473
I hope to see my friend and shake his hand.

1703
02:17:37,065 --> 02:17:41,545
I hope the Pacific is as blue as it has been in my dreams.

1704
02:17:43,029 --> 02:17:44,449
I hope.
