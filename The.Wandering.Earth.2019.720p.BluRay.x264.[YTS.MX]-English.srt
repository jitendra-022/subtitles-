00:01:11,796 --> 00:01:12,630
<i>Hurry up!</i>

4
00:01:12,713 --> 00:01:14,380
<i>Look! It's Jupiter!</i>

5
00:01:15,171 --> 00:01:17,296
<i>The largest planet in the Solar System.</i>

6
00:01:19,713 --> 00:01:22,421
Daddy, there is an eye on Jupiter.

7
00:01:22,505 --> 00:01:25,296
That's a huge windstorm on Jupiter.

8
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:26,588
What's a windstorm?

9
00:01:26,671 --> 00:01:29,088
Jupiter is like a huge balloon,

10
00:01:29,421 --> 00:01:31,546
composed of 90% hydrogen.

11
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:33,838
Grandpa, you know what's hydrogen?

12
00:01:34,338 --> 00:01:36,130
What is hydrogen?

13
00:01:36,671 --> 00:01:39,005
It's the fuel for Daddy's rocket.

14
00:01:39,088 --> 00:01:40,255
You see, Grandpa.

15
00:01:40,338 --> 00:01:42,546
Hydrogen is a fuel for Daddy's rocket.

16
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:43,713
Oh.

17
00:01:43,796 --> 00:01:44,880
Liu Qi.

18
00:01:44,963 --> 00:01:45,963
Huh?

19
00:01:46,005 --> 00:01:47,588
<i>A day may come</i>

20
00:01:47,796 --> 00:01:50,255
<i>when you can see Jupiter
without a telescope...</i>

21
00:01:51,296 --> 00:01:52,463
<i>Daddy will come back.</i>

22
00:01:54,046 --> 00:01:55,088
<i>Where are you going?</i>

23
00:01:56,588 --> 00:01:58,148
<i>Daddy is going on a mission.</i>

24
00:01:58,796 --> 00:02:00,588
<i>The world's most important mission.</i>

25
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:06,505
<i>After I leave,</i>

26
00:02:06,921 --> 00:02:08,630
<i>you'll be Liu Qi's only guardian.</i>

27
00:02:10,463 --> 00:02:11,463
And with this,

28
00:02:11,838 --> 00:02:15,046
you'll get underground city residency
without drawing lots.

29
00:02:15,755 --> 00:02:17,005
It's the only way

30
00:02:18,588 --> 00:02:20,255
to make sure you'll survive

31
00:02:21,421 --> 00:02:22,921
<i>both you and Liu Qi.</i>

32
00:02:25,546 --> 00:02:28,426
- I didn't have a choice.
- That's enough. Trust me, I get it.

33
00:02:38,671 --> 00:02:39,796
<i>Father...</i>

34
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:43,380
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

35
00:02:50,546 --> 00:02:51,463
<i>At first,</i>

36
00:02:51,546 --> 00:02:52,921
<i>nobody cared about this disaster.</i>

37
00:02:53,005 --> 00:02:55,189
<i>The number of wildfires,
has been the highest...</i>

38
00:02:55,213 --> 00:02:56,564
<i>Just another wildfire...</i>

39
00:02:56,588 --> 00:02:58,708
<i>...several locations all over the planet.</i>

40
00:02:58,921 --> 00:03:00,106
<i>...another drought...</i>

41
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:01,564
<i>...survival of the planet.</i>

42
00:03:01,588 --> 00:03:03,268
<i>Sea level continues to drop...</i>

43
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:05,176
<i>...another extinction of a species...</i>

44
00:03:05,213 --> 00:03:08,333
<i>And this had intervened
to prevent further spreading of the riots.</i>

45
00:03:08,921 --> 00:03:10,401
<i>...another vanishing city.</i>

46
00:03:12,005 --> 00:03:15,713
<i>Until everyone was entwined
with this disaster.</i>

47
00:03:17,921 --> 00:03:20,921
<i>The Sun is rapidly degenerating
and expanding.</i>

48
00:03:22,546 --> 00:03:26,213
<i>At this rate, the Sun will engulf Earth
in 100 years.</i>

49
00:03:28,046 --> 00:03:31,796
<i>Within 300 years,
the Solar System will no longer exist.</i>

50
00:03:35,213 --> 00:03:37,296
<i>To face this cataclysmic catastrophe,</i>

51
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:39,505
<i>mankind united like never seen before.</i>

52
00:03:39,588 --> 00:03:41,314
<i>...to prevent the future catastrophe...</i>

53
00:03:41,338 --> 00:03:43,731
<i>In order to maximize
the chance of human survival,</i>

54
00:03:43,755 --> 00:03:45,213
<i>the United Earth Government</i>

55
00:03:45,296 --> 00:03:48,088
<i>decided to propel Earth
out of our Solar System</i>

56
00:03:48,213 --> 00:03:51,380
<i>to fly towards our new home
4.2 light years away.</i>

57
00:03:52,130 --> 00:03:54,588
<i>This mighty and enduring human migration</i>

58
00:03:55,088 --> 00:03:57,088
<i>is named as the Wandering Earth Project.</i>

59
00:03:57,171 --> 00:03:59,963
<i>The first test
starts in 36 months' time.</i>

60
00:04:00,546 --> 00:04:02,713
<i>Mankind will devote
every possible resource</i>

61
00:04:02,796 --> 00:04:05,755
<i>to construct 10,000 Earth Engines
on the planet's surface</i>

62
00:04:05,838 --> 00:04:08,588
<i>to propel Earth out of the Solar System.</i>

63
00:04:09,505 --> 00:04:12,421
<i>The height of every
Propulsion Engine is 11,000 meters.</i>

64
00:04:12,505 --> 00:04:13,338
<i>They will provide</i>

65
00:04:13,421 --> 00:04:16,296
<i>a total of 150 trillion tons
of propulsive force.</i>

66
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:17,213
<i>Salute!</i>

67
00:04:17,296 --> 00:04:19,356
<i>The construction
of the Navigation Platform</i>

68
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:21,838
<i>International Space Station
will be completed</i>

69
00:04:21,921 --> 00:04:23,630
<i>at the beginning of this month.</i>

70
00:04:23,713 --> 00:04:25,796
<i>Three hundred eleven Chinese senior pilots</i>

71
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:28,189
<i>- and 709 engineers that were selected.
- One. Lift off.</i>

72
00:04:28,213 --> 00:04:30,671
<i>Meanwhile,
to safeguard Earth's trajectory,</i>

73
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:35,088
<i>the United Earth Government consolidated
global astronautical capabilities</i>

74
00:04:35,171 --> 00:04:39,630
<i>and spent 30 years building the Navigation
Platform International Space Station.</i>

75
00:04:42,255 --> 00:04:45,213
<i>The Navigation Platform
International Space Station</i>

76
00:04:45,296 --> 00:04:49,213
<i>will travel with a relative position
of 100,000 kilometers from Earth.</i>

77
00:04:49,296 --> 00:04:52,921
<i>It will provide warnings, navigations,
and communications for Earth.</i>

78
00:04:56,463 --> 00:04:58,505
<i>Centrifugal drive,
ready for activation.</i>

79
00:04:59,213 --> 00:05:02,880
<i>Worldwide sea level
will rise 300 meters in ten years' time.</i>

80
00:05:02,963 --> 00:05:04,421
<i>The cities of Haikou and Zhanjiang</i>

81
00:05:04,505 --> 00:05:06,213
<i>will be the first to be hit
by the tsunami.</i>

82
00:05:06,296 --> 00:05:08,796
<i>To deal with the rapidly
deteriorating conditions,</i>

83
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:13,005
<i>the UEG constructed an underground city
beneath each Earth Engine.</i>

84
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:16,588
<i>Until Earth's arrival at its new home,</i>

85
00:05:17,213 --> 00:05:19,380
<i>these will be the only refuge for mankind.</i>

86
00:05:19,463 --> 00:05:21,189
<i>The right to underground residency</i>

87
00:05:21,213 --> 00:05:22,838
<i>will be selected by drawing lots.</i>

88
00:05:22,921 --> 00:05:25,296
<i>A winning lot cannot be transferred,
shared, or gifted.</i>

89
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:27,463
<i>Beginning now, mankind,</i>

90
00:05:27,546 --> 00:05:29,796
<i>a tiny tribe of the Solar System,</i>

91
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:33,588
<i>will be embarking upon a 2,500-year
wandering voyage.</i>

92
00:05:33,671 --> 00:05:35,481
- Don't rush, walk slowly!
<i>- The surface temperature</i>

93
00:05:35,505 --> 00:05:38,171
<i>will drop to minus 70 degrees Celsius
this year.</i>

94
00:05:38,255 --> 00:05:40,546
<i>Surface residents
from each district will be located...</i>

95
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:42,046
Easy. Hey.

96
00:05:42,505 --> 00:05:44,546
- Hey.
- Don't push!

97
00:06:03,921 --> 00:06:05,713
<i>Daddy will fly up into the sky</i>

98
00:06:06,171 --> 00:06:07,713
<i>and turn into a star</i>

99
00:06:08,338 --> 00:06:10,380
<i>to always watch over you.</i>

100
00:06:11,713 --> 00:06:15,796
<i>Daddy, is it true that
you're going to turn into a star?</i>

101
00:06:16,463 --> 00:06:17,463
<i>Of course.</i>

102
00:06:18,171 --> 00:06:20,796
<i>From now on, you just have to count</i>

103
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:22,380
<i>three,</i>

104
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:23,880
<i>two,</i>

105
00:06:24,588 --> 00:06:25,588
<i>one.</i>

106
00:06:26,421 --> 00:06:27,421
<i>Look up.</i>

107
00:06:28,005 --> 00:06:29,255
<i>You will see Daddy.</i>

108
00:06:43,213 --> 00:06:44,963
<i>Goodbye, Solar System.</i>

109
00:06:47,421 --> 00:06:49,963
<i>Goodbye, Solar System.</i>

110
00:06:50,046 --> 00:06:52,213
<i>Bye.</i>

111
00:06:58,796 --> 00:07:02,338
<i>Goodbye, Solar System.</i>

112
00:07:08,838 --> 00:07:10,671
<i>Welcome to</i> The Morning News.

113
00:07:10,755 --> 00:07:12,463
<i>These are today's headlines...</i>

114
00:07:12,546 --> 00:07:14,421
<i>With the arrival of the new year,</i>

115
00:07:14,505 --> 00:07:18,171
<i>the first batch of personnel from
the Navigation Platform will be returning,</i>

116
00:07:18,255 --> 00:07:21,338
<i>having completed 15 to 20 years
of station duties.</i>

117
00:07:21,713 --> 00:07:26,171
<i>Underground citizens around the world
are eagerly anticipating their arrival.</i>

118
00:07:26,255 --> 00:07:27,335
<i>Therefore...</i>

119
00:08:14,963 --> 00:08:17,713
"Anticipating. Anticipating.

120
00:08:17,796 --> 00:08:19,421
Spring breeze has arrived.

121
00:08:19,505 --> 00:08:22,046
The spring now is heading
closer and closer.

122
00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:24,671
The yearly planning starts with spring.

123
00:08:24,755 --> 00:08:26,380
It's full of effort.

124
00:08:26,463 --> 00:08:28,130
It's full of hope."

125
00:08:28,213 --> 00:08:29,606
Zhou Qian, tell us.

126
00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:31,213
How do you define hope?

127
00:08:31,421 --> 00:08:33,630
Hope is something precious.

128
00:08:33,713 --> 00:08:35,713
It's precious like a diamond...

129
00:08:35,796 --> 00:08:36,838
...for our time.

130
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:39,546
Hope is the only direction.

131
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:41,310
The only direction to our home.

132
00:08:41,338 --> 00:08:43,213
Well said. Please sit, Zhou Qian.

133
00:08:43,296 --> 00:08:45,630
Han Duoduo, do you have any thoughts?

134
00:08:46,046 --> 00:08:47,671
Well, I have nothing to say.

135
00:08:49,046 --> 00:08:50,755
I just want to take a look outside.

136
00:08:50,921 --> 00:08:52,380
But it's too dangerous outside.

137
00:08:56,755 --> 00:08:59,522
Be seated. Class, don't panic.
It's just a display malfunction.

138
00:08:59,546 --> 00:09:02,106
- Let's go. Let's go.
- Go back. Xiao Ming, go back.

139
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:04,290
Class, don't panic.

140
00:09:06,755 --> 00:09:08,380
- Did you do this?
- Shut up! Let's go!

141
00:09:08,463 --> 00:09:10,921
Teacher, look,
Han Duoduo has just run away!

142
00:09:11,005 --> 00:09:12,671
<i>Happy New Year, folks.</i>

143
00:09:12,755 --> 00:09:14,397
- <i>Why don't you celebrate?</i>
- Happy New Year!

144
00:09:14,421 --> 00:09:15,255
Hu Kou.

145
00:09:15,338 --> 00:09:17,838
Is the Committee giving out
dumplings tonight?

146
00:09:18,046 --> 00:09:19,505
Come. All you think about is food!

147
00:09:19,588 --> 00:09:22,296
- Where is Grandpa's vehicle pass?
- I've got it.

148
00:09:22,713 --> 00:09:24,588
Shall we grab some dumplings
before we leave?

149
00:09:24,671 --> 00:09:27,338
- Forget it. Don't come then!
- Liar!

150
00:09:27,421 --> 00:09:28,838
You said you'll take me outside.

151
00:09:28,921 --> 00:09:31,213
<i>All personnel,
return to your post.</i>

152
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:33,171
<i>All personnel, return to your post.</i>

153
00:09:35,463 --> 00:09:37,630
- Where is my order?
- It's here.

154
00:09:37,713 --> 00:09:39,838
Durian-flavored, dried earthworms!

155
00:09:40,338 --> 00:09:41,439
What are you looking at?

156
00:09:41,463 --> 00:09:43,213
Hey, come on,
it's just a day trip.

157
00:09:43,296 --> 00:09:45,380
- What's the rush?
- That's what it is to you.

158
00:09:45,463 --> 00:09:46,838
I'm not planning on returning.

159
00:09:47,546 --> 00:09:50,588
Get moving!
We are going nowhere without the suits.

160
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:54,046
You had the mahjong I needed,
why didn't you discard it?

161
00:09:54,130 --> 00:09:56,296
I was going to win. What the fuck?

162
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:57,439
Isn't that bunny girl's tail

163
00:09:57,463 --> 00:09:58,546
- soft and sweet?
- Hey, no.

164
00:09:59,046 --> 00:10:01,439
- Are we meant to be together, angel?
- No. I told you. You and I...

165
00:10:01,463 --> 00:10:03,546
Now tell me, what are you doing here?
It's New Year!

166
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:05,870
I can't believe how cheeky you are.

167
00:10:08,921 --> 00:10:09,921
Hey.

168
00:10:10,255 --> 00:10:11,296
Let's go.

169
00:10:12,046 --> 00:10:13,088
Yi Ge?

170
00:10:16,463 --> 00:10:17,755
- Yi Ge?
- Bring it on.

171
00:10:18,130 --> 00:10:19,421
Are the suits ready?

172
00:10:20,546 --> 00:10:22,255
You have the stuff?

173
00:10:24,213 --> 00:10:25,046
Pretty new.

174
00:10:25,130 --> 00:10:26,713
Fully checked. They work.

175
00:10:27,838 --> 00:10:29,255
And I got you skewers, too.

176
00:10:29,671 --> 00:10:30,671
Freshly made.

177
00:10:34,755 --> 00:10:35,755
Good.

178
00:10:44,088 --> 00:10:45,088
Grab the suits.

179
00:11:02,296 --> 00:11:03,380
How old are you?

180
00:11:04,421 --> 00:11:06,880
Hey, check out this tag Yi Ge made!

181
00:11:06,963 --> 00:11:08,546
Just like the real thing.

182
00:11:09,130 --> 00:11:10,546
- It's yours.
- Thanks, Yi Ge.

183
00:11:12,671 --> 00:11:14,130
Return the suits tomorrow.

184
00:11:16,838 --> 00:11:18,421
Thanks, Yi Ge. See you.

185
00:11:19,505 --> 00:11:20,338
Hurry up and move.

186
00:11:20,421 --> 00:11:21,814
Didn't you say
you are not coming back?

187
00:11:21,838 --> 00:11:22,838
Hold it.

188
00:11:26,796 --> 00:11:28,296
You're not coming back?

189
00:11:29,588 --> 00:11:31,255
And this is all you paid me?

190
00:11:31,713 --> 00:11:33,546
For two of my thermal suits?

191
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:36,463
Yi Ge, I'll make it up when I get back.

192
00:11:36,546 --> 00:11:37,838
For years, I have been known...

193
00:11:38,838 --> 00:11:40,713
for honest trading only.

194
00:11:40,796 --> 00:11:42,421
No credit given.

195
00:11:42,505 --> 00:11:45,380
Yi Ge, I really need to go out today.

196
00:11:48,005 --> 00:11:49,838
What for?

197
00:11:50,838 --> 00:11:53,005
Just stay here with your sis
for the New Year.

198
00:11:56,838 --> 00:11:58,921
Hey, boss, look! He's gonna do it!

199
00:11:59,255 --> 00:12:00,505
Look!

200
00:12:00,588 --> 00:12:02,005
You filthy repairman.

201
00:12:02,088 --> 00:12:03,546
I dare you! Use it here...

202
00:12:06,005 --> 00:12:07,005
Oh, man.

203
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:09,564
Duoduo, get down.

204
00:12:17,088 --> 00:12:18,880
I want him dead!

205
00:12:20,755 --> 00:12:21,963
<i>Dear friends...</i>

206
00:12:44,171 --> 00:12:46,046

- Excuse us.

00:12:50,546 --> 00:12:52,689
- Good luck out there, buddy.
<i>- Please wear your suit</i>

208

209
00:12:54,505 --> 00:12:55,630
Will they report us?

210
00:12:55,713 --> 00:12:56,713
These suits were stolen.

211
00:12:56,755 --> 00:12:59,005
They'll expose themselves if they report.

212
00:12:59,546 --> 00:13:01,338

00:13:29,505 --> 00:13:30,338
Excuse me.

224
00:13:30,421 --> 00:13:32,421
Can I chew gum while wearing the helmet?

225
00:13:32,505 --> 00:13:34,064
- Chew what?
- What is your problem?

226
00:13:34,088 --> 00:13:36,671
<i>Check all thermal suits and helmets.</i>

227
00:13:36,755 --> 00:13:37,796
<i>Please wait here.</i>

228
00:13:39,171 --> 00:13:40,005
<i>In three days,</i>

229
00:13:40,088 --> 00:13:42,008

<i>Attention,

235
00:14:08,921 --> 00:14:10,963
Oh, my.

236
00:14:15,838 --> 00:14:17,213
Just look at yourself.

237
00:14:17,296 --> 00:14:18,731
Is it your first time outside?

238
00:14:18,755 --> 00:14:20,630
Have you ever been outside?

239
00:14:20,713 --> 00:14:22,421
It wasn't this crowded last time.

240
00:14:22,838 --> 00:14:24,546
You are such a liar.

241
00:14:26,463 --> 00:14:28,630
How long to get to the surface?

242
00:14:28,713 --> 00:14:30,338
It's five kilometers,

243
00:14:30,421 --> 00:14:32,463
so at least 15 minutes.

244
00:14:33,213 --> 00:14:34,213
Okay.

245
00:14:45,921 --> 00:14:47,189
It's a communication device.

246
00:14:47,213 --> 00:14:48,921
Press once to sync with the transporter.

247
00:14:49,005 --> 00:14:50,213
Twice for regional broadcast.

248
00:14:50,296 --> 00:14:51,838
Three times for the private channel.

249
00:14:51,921 --> 00:14:53,838
Once outside, stay close to me.

250
00:14:54,088 --> 00:14:55,171
No running around.

251
00:14:55,671 --> 00:14:56,838
Are you afraid?

252
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:29,935
<i>Surface level reached.</i>

253
00:15:29,963 --> 00:15:32,588
<i>All personnel, please be ready.</i>

254
00:16:07,713 --> 00:16:08,713
Let's go!

255
00:16:12,921 --> 00:16:15,088
Haven't you had enough
looking around? Let's go!

256
00:16:15,171 --> 00:16:16,588
I snuck out.

257
00:16:16,671 --> 00:16:18,338
Am I going to get expelled?

258
00:16:18,546 --> 00:16:20,346
Have you already been
kicked out of your unit?

259
00:16:20,421 --> 00:16:21,505
Nonsense.

260
00:16:25,046 --> 00:16:27,796
Which one is Transporter 373?

261
00:16:28,296 --> 00:16:29,380
Duoduo, come here!

262
00:16:29,755 --> 00:16:30,755
Okay.

263
00:16:32,796 --> 00:16:34,963
- Give me Grandpa's vehicle pass.
- Here.

264
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:45,546
<i>Han Ziang.
Senior driver.</i>

265
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:48,838
<i>Beijing No. 3 Transportation Division

<i>Routes are countless.</i>

00:16:50,463 --> 00:16:52,005
<i>Safety is foremost.</i>

268
00:16:52,296 --> 00:16:53,838
<i>With unregulated driving,</i>

269
00:16:53,921 --> 00:16:56,213
<i>your loved ones might end up in tears.</i>

270
00:17:00,838 --> 00:17:03,088
This is the clutch. This is the gear.

271
00:17:08,088 --> 00:17:09,171
What the...

272
00:17:09,296 --> 00:17:11,171
Can you even drive, Hu Kou?

273
00:17:11,255 --> 00:17:13,130
This transporter is not for everyone!

274
00:17:13,213 --> 00:17:15,171
It requires five years of training.

275
00:17:15,255 --> 00:17:17,106
- I am a genius just for making it move.
- Hmm...

276
00:17:17,130 --> 00:17:18,130
- Okay?
- Genius.

277
00:17:18,171 --> 00:17:21,671
Just step on the clutch, hand on the gear.
Heavy step, light hand.

278
00:17:28,588 --> 00:17:29,713
Watch out! People ahead!

279
00:17:29,796 --> 00:17:31,296
- Watch out!
- Shit! Fuck!

280
00:17:41,838 --> 00:17:43,880
Watch out! Watch out!

281
00:17:50,921 --> 00:17:54,546
<i>The world outside is huge!</i>

282
00:17:54,630 --> 00:17:56,921
<i>What are you yelling about?
So embarrassing.</i>

283
00:17:57,005 --> 00:17:58,005
Wow.

284
00:17:58,171 --> 00:17:59,963
Such strong winds today.

285
00:18:00,046 --> 00:18:01,921
Why are they mining these mountains?

286
00:18:02,005 --> 00:18:03,421
It's for fuel.

287
00:18:03,505 --> 00:18:05,213
Heavy fusion propulsion technology.

288
00:18:05,796 --> 00:18:08,213
Well, basically, it's just burning rocks.

289
00:18:08,296 --> 00:18:10,671
Whoa! That's the Earth Engine!

290
00:18:10,755 --> 00:18:12,338
These are Propulsion Engines.

291
00:18:12,755 --> 00:18:16,088
There are 10,000 of them around the globe,
made for pushing Earth forward.

292
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:17,713
This isn't the most gigantic one.

293
00:18:17,838 --> 00:18:19,796
Those Torque Engines along the equator,

294
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:21,838
they are the real giants.

295
00:19:38,671 --> 00:19:41,088
<i>Synchronal translation activated.</i>

296
00:19:41,588 --> 00:19:44,130
Peiqiang, happy retirement.

297
00:19:49,921 --> 00:19:51,421
One more day until I go home.

298
00:19:51,796 --> 00:19:53,213
Don't stir my dignity.

299
00:19:53,296 --> 00:19:54,796
Save this moonshine for yourself.

300
00:19:55,130 --> 00:19:57,921
Okay, I will store it
somewhere safe for you.

301
00:19:58,005 --> 00:19:59,838
Save it for your farewell party.

302
00:19:59,921 --> 00:20:02,130
We are not getting another chance
once we hibernate.

303
00:20:10,005 --> 00:20:11,546
Don't you know that

304
00:20:11,838 --> 00:20:15,380
vodka was smuggled onboard
back in Yuri Gagarin's day?

305

<i>O2 level stable.</i>

306
00:20:28,338 --> 00:20:30,296
We'll be entering
Jupiter's orbit today, right?

307
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:34,421
Yes, we began preparing already
for Emergency Protocol No. 3.

308
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:36,713
Something doesn't feel right.

309
00:20:37,338 --> 00:20:38,630
There's no other way.

310
00:20:38,713 --> 00:20:42,296
Earth can't leave the Solar System
without using Jupiter's gravity.

311
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:43,820
It is a risk we must take.

312
00:20:44,005 --> 00:20:45,088
God will bless us.

313
00:20:45,338 --> 00:20:47,505
Once this is over, you can return home.

314
00:20:48,796 --> 00:20:50,996
It's the last procedure
for daily inspection.

315
00:20:51,171 --> 00:20:53,213
Check the Centrifugal Drive Control unit.

316
00:20:53,463 --> 00:20:55,963
Record the temperatures
of the Centrifugal axle bearings.

317
00:20:59,046 --> 00:21:00,213
Understood.

318

<i>We are grateful for your contributions
over the past 17 years.</i>

324
00:21:23,838 --> 00:21:26,838
<i>Congratulations on the completion
of your duty and journey home tomorrow.</i>

325
00:21:41,046 --> 00:21:42,463
My dear friend.

326
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:46,546
Let's see each other together on Earth
three years from now.

327
00:21:46,796 --> 00:21:49,088
But now, please,
go catch up with your son.

328
00:21:49,171 --> 00:21:51,255
You haven't spoken to him for a decade.

329
00:21:55,963 --> 00:21:57,421
I'll see you again on Earth.

330
00:22:03,630 --> 00:22:05,088
Here, my friend.

331
00:22:05,713 --> 00:22:08,213
You're stuck with me
for the next three years now.

332
00:22:30,671 --> 00:22:33,296
<i>Jupiter's gravitational spike detected.</i>

<i>Earth's trajectory is off course
by 9.23 degrees,</i>

334
00:22:36,796 --> 00:22:38,630

335

<i>Disaster warning protocols activated.</i>

339
00:22:57,838 --> 00:23:00,255
There's a supply station
50 kilometers ahead.

340
00:23:04,130 --> 00:23:06,713
Once we get there,
you go back by yourself.

341
00:23:07,963 --> 00:23:10,713
Catch the first shuttle back,
so grandpa won't worry about us.

342
00:23:10,796 --> 00:23:12,838
Oh, come on.

343
00:23:13,171 --> 00:23:16,380
If your dad catches you,
he's gonna kick your ass.

344
00:23:16,463 --> 00:23:17,963
You know I'm a genius.

345
00:23:18,046 --> 00:23:19,213
No one can catch me.

346
00:23:20,421 --> 00:23:22,380
What the hell? Check point.

347
00:23:24,421 --> 00:23:26,189
How did you get in here?

348
00:23:26,213 --> 00:23:27,880
Well, unregulated driving.

349
00:23:27,963 --> 00:23:30,546
Unregulated? You committed theft!

350
00:23:30,630 --> 00:23:32,838
It's my grandpa's vehicle pass.
I didn't steal it

351
00:23:32,921 --> 00:23:33,838
Nonsense.

352
00:23:33,921 --> 00:23:36,463
All transporters belong to the UEG
as public property.

353
00:23:36,546 --> 00:23:37,796
It's not up to your grandpa!

354
00:23:40,421 --> 00:23:42,397
What are you doing?
It's way past bedtime.

355
00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:43,421
Yes, sir.

356
00:23:43,921 --> 00:23:46,088
Uh, I'm just getting
to know new friends, that's all.

357
00:23:46,171 --> 00:23:48,130
More friends, more options.

358
00:23:48,213 --> 00:23:49,213
Hand it over.

359
00:23:50,963 --> 00:23:52,380
- You think it is yours?
- Mm.

360
00:23:52,463 --> 00:23:53,755
- Hit the sack.
- Mm.

361
00:23:55,130 --> 00:23:56,250
Have a nice stroll.

362
00:23:58,005 --> 00:23:59,505
I am Tim, eh.

363
00:23:59,838 --> 00:24:01,758
My dad is from Beijing,
my mom is from Melbourne.

364
00:24:01,838 --> 00:24:03,588
Chinese-Australian coproduction.

365
00:24:03,671 --> 00:24:05,421
Come on, just joking. Let's shake hands.

366
00:24:05,546 --> 00:24:06,546
Huh?

367
00:24:09,630 --> 00:24:10,630
Hello.

368
00:24:10,713 --> 00:24:11,713
Coproduction.

369
00:24:11,755 --> 00:24:12,981
Let go of me!

370
00:24:13,005 --> 00:24:15,213
Ow, that hurts!

371
00:24:25,255 --> 00:24:26,535
<i>Name of the visitor?</i>

372
00:24:27,796 --> 00:24:28,838
<i>Han Ziang.</i>

373
00:24:29,505 --> 00:24:30,963
<i>I'm here for my grandson.</i>

374
00:24:42,671 --> 00:24:43,755
Huh?

375
00:24:46,255 --> 00:24:47,296
What?

376
00:24:48,171 --> 00:24:49,255
Yes.

377
00:24:49,338 --> 00:24:51,088
Someone's here
to bail you out.

378
00:24:56,630 --> 00:24:58,171
Hello, sir.

379
00:24:58,338 --> 00:25:00,088
My grandson is a mechanic trainee.

380
00:25:00,171 --> 00:25:01,713
He just wanted to touch a real thing.

381
00:25:01,796 --> 00:25:03,046
Maybe you can, uh...

382
00:25:03,171 --> 00:25:04,338
- go easy on him?
- Hey.

383
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:08,880
Transporters are highly valuable
public property.

384
00:25:08,963 --> 00:25:11,338
- Uh...
- Lending out your vehicle pass privately

385
00:25:11,421 --> 00:25:13,171
is also a serious offense.

386
00:25:16,255 --> 00:25:17,380
Oh, well.

387
00:25:17,755 --> 00:25:19,088
This is good stuff.

388
00:25:19,796 --> 00:25:22,671
It has a collection of hotties
from the past 50 years.

389
00:25:22,755 --> 00:25:23,921
It's all in here.

390
00:25:25,505 --> 00:25:27,338
Oh, well...

391
00:25:29,755 --> 00:25:31,005
Same old trick.

392
00:25:31,505 --> 00:25:32,505
Hm?

393
00:25:47,630 --> 00:25:50,130
Stop doing that, old man.

394
00:25:56,338 --> 00:25:57,921
What old man?

395
00:25:58,005 --> 00:25:59,671
I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for you.

396
00:25:59,755 --> 00:26:00,630
Running away from home.

397
00:26:00,713 --> 00:26:02,522
You're too old to be running away.

398
00:26:02,546 --> 00:26:03,380
He is your own father.

399
00:26:03,463 --> 00:26:06,147
Where are you going to hide?
You even brought your little sister out?

400
00:26:06,171 --> 00:26:08,046
Outside is dangerous!

401
00:26:08,838 --> 00:26:10,296
And you!

402
00:26:12,588 --> 00:26:14,463
You learned to steal now?

403
00:26:14,755 --> 00:26:15,838
Huh?

404
00:26:15,921 --> 00:26:17,380
You stole my pass!

405
00:26:17,463 --> 00:26:19,505
Do you do whatever your brother
tells you to do?

406
00:26:19,796 --> 00:26:21,171
Are you stupid?

407
00:26:21,463 --> 00:26:22,939
I didn't intend to bring her along.

408
00:26:22,963 --> 00:26:24,647
- But she was begging me...
- You're her brother!

409
00:26:24,671 --> 00:26:26,338
...to take her.

410
00:26:26,421 --> 00:26:27,546
Liu Qi!

411
00:26:27,630 --> 00:26:29,838
- You're such a liar!
- Here she goes again.

412
00:26:29,921 --> 00:26:31,005
Nicely said.

413
00:26:31,088 --> 00:26:32,630
Ignoring your elder's advice is so...

414
00:26:32,713 --> 00:26:34,106
Why don't you mind your own business?

415
00:26:34,130 --> 00:26:36,647
Don't take it out on the wall,
take it out on me if you...

416
00:26:36,671 --> 00:26:38,838
What the hell?

417
00:26:46,130 --> 00:26:47,505
It's an earthquake!

418
00:26:47,588 --> 00:26:49,005
Thirteen Orphans!

419
00:26:49,338 --> 00:26:50,338

420
00:27:05,088 --> 00:27:07,755

422
00:27:09,838 --> 00:27:11,213

<i>Have you seen Liu Qi?</i>

493

Liu Qi is right here with me.

Emergency authorization code

You know that girl from the other day

521
00:34:01,546 --> 00:34:03,463
- was totally consensual.
- You shut up.

522
00:34:03,838 --> 00:34:05,046
They are not here for you.

523
00:34:05,671 --> 00:34:06,671
Huh?

524
00:34:07,130 --> 00:34:08,130
Hm.

525
00:34:09,505 --> 00:34:13,005
We are a rescue team, unit CN171-11,

526

What could be that important?

535
00:34:39,213 --> 00:34:40,814
<i>Boss!

<i>Wait. Isn't that
the Earth Engine's trigger device?</i>

541

No Earth Engine has shut down
for the past 30 years.

542
00:34:56,588 --> 00:34:58,505
This is not a simple rescue mission.

543
00:34:58,588 --> 00:35:00,005
A lot of people will die.

544
00:35:00,213 --> 00:35:01,130
<i>Boss!</i>

<i>Clear the road!</i>

00:36:05,463 --> 00:36:06,838

Unit 09, 13, and 15's signals
were last received at Huaian.

567
00:36:30,755 --> 00:36:32,814
The rest of the units have made it
to the Shanghai Region

568
00:36:32,838 --> 00:36:34,130
and are en route to Hangzhou.

569

- Boss.
- You guys go take a look.

570
00:36:36,838 --> 00:36:38,421
- Roger that.
- Yes, sir.

571
00:36:49,713 --> 00:36:51,171
Liu Zi, scout the area.

572
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:10,796
Our team is up ahead.
The estimated distance is 80km.

573
00:37:11,088 --> 00:37:12,796
Follow the crevasse.
Rendezvous in an hour.

574
00:37:15,838 --> 00:37:17,546
This place worries me.

575
00:37:17,796 --> 00:37:19,588
Pass through as soon as possible.

576
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:22,130
- Load up. Move out.
- Roger.

577
00:37:31,630 --> 00:37:33,213
<i>Engineer team, stay alert.</i>

Don't be afraid.

588
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:13,255
This was Grandpa's home.

589
00:38:14,713 --> 00:38:16,380
Look at those tall buildings,

590
00:38:17,380 --> 00:38:19,296
once, they were full of people.

591
00:38:20,796 --> 00:38:21,880
<i>Back then,</i>

592
00:38:22,421 --> 00:38:24,796
<i>no one was concerned about the Sun.</i>

593
00:38:25,296 --> 00:38:27,171
<i>Everyone was concerned about</i>

594
00:38:27,755 --> 00:38:29,588
<i>the thing called money.</i>

595
00:38:31,296 --> 00:38:33,796
Grandpa couldn't make
a lot of money back then,

596
00:38:34,505 --> 00:38:36,630
but I was happy every day.

597
00:38:37,463 --> 00:38:39,713
<i>Especially on my way home every day,</i>

598
00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:44,255
<i>I could smell from far away
your grandma's cooking.</i>

599
00:38:46,421 --> 00:38:49,421
<i>Actually, to be honest,
she could barely cook,</i>

600
00:38:50,296 --> 00:38:52,213
<i>except for the scallion noodles.</i>

601
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:53,463
I tell you,

602
00:38:53,546 --> 00:38:55,338
her scallion noodles...

603
00:38:57,296 --> 00:38:59,130
...were incredibly salty.

604
00:39:00,005 --> 00:39:02,046
But I slurped them up.

605
00:39:02,130 --> 00:39:05,046
Cleaned my bowl every time.

MOSS. Where's my son now?

612
00:39:32,171 --> 00:39:33,255
Why are they in Shanghai?

613
00:39:33,338 --> 00:39:34,630
<i>Transporter 373</i>

<i>Thanks for your understanding.</i>

630
00:40:07,963 --> 00:40:10,296
I'll resettle the civilians
at the Jiaxing refuge center.

631
00:40:10,796 --> 00:40:12,380
But a transporter needs special skills.

We'll be needing driver Han Ziang.

When we get to Jiaxing,
let Grandpa and the others get off.

00:40:52,296 --> 00:40:53,380
Tell me I'm wrong.

647
00:40:56,046 --> 00:40:57,255
<i>After I leave,</i>

648
00:40:59,546 --> 00:41:01,505
<i>only one guardian can accompany Liu Qi</i>

649
00:41:01,588 --> 00:41:03,171
- <i>into the underground city.</i>
- Mama!

650
00:41:03,713 --> 00:41:05,005
<i>She's gravely ill.</i>

651
00:41:05,546 --> 00:41:07,213
<i>She won't hold up much longer.</i>

652
00:41:07,921 --> 00:41:09,421
<i>Stopping treatments...</i>

653
00:41:12,463 --> 00:41:15,338
<i>...is the only way
to ensure both of you and Liu Qi</i>

654
00:41:15,421 --> 00:41:16,546
<i>will survive.</i>

655
00:41:17,671 --> 00:41:19,213
That's enough. I get it.

656
00:41:23,130 --> 00:41:24,130
So be it.

657
00:41:26,213 --> 00:41:27,213
<i>Father...</i>

658
00:41:31,255 --> 00:41:32,255

<i>Atmospheric pressure is dropping.</i>

664
00:41:54,838 --> 00:41:57,171

<i>Jupiter's gravitational spike detected.</i>

Brace yourselves.

00:42:06,546 --> 00:42:08,255
Something is about to hit us from behind.

669

The glass is going to crack!

675
00:42:41,463 --> 00:42:43,963
Oh, my god! Am I gonna die here?

676
00:42:44,046 --> 00:42:46,130
Oh, well, death is normal.

677
00:42:49,755 --> 00:42:52,630

00:43:04,005 --> 00:43:05,005
Go away!

681
00:43:05,755 --> 00:43:06,963
Let go!

682
00:43:08,005 --> 00:43:09,005
Two hundred meters ahead!

Go!

686
00:43:22,255 --> 00:43:23,796
Come on, keep moving.

What? Evacuation?

692
00:43:48,713 --> 00:43:50,671
MOSS, connect me to the UEG.

Open the cabin, MOSS!

MOSS, open the cabin!

699

This is insubordination!

700

- Help!
- Help!

705
00:44:33,546 --> 00:44:34,671
Help!

706
00:44:36,463 --> 00:44:39,671
Didn't you say death was normal?

707
00:44:39,755 --> 00:44:40,796
Huh?

708
00:44:41,380 --> 00:44:42,963
Help us!

709
00:44:44,005 --> 00:44:46,088
<i>Boss, we've lost contact
with the other units.</i>

710
00:44:46,171 --> 00:44:47,380
<i>I can't reach them!</i>

711
00:44:47,921 --> 00:44:49,421
Transport the Lighter Core with me.

712
00:44:49,505 --> 00:44:51,731
Chui Zi, Ya Tou, save the others.
Liu Zi, find a way out!

713
00:44:51,755 --> 00:44:53,675
- Everyone, abandon the vehicle!
- Yes, sir!

714
00:44:56,505 --> 00:44:57,505
Go!

715
00:44:59,755 --> 00:45:00,755
Get inside!

716
00:45:05,046 --> 00:45:06,755
Quick! Get in, quick!

717
00:45:08,005 --> 00:45:09,755
Help us! Help us!

718
00:45:10,588 --> 00:45:11,588
What's going on?

719
00:45:11,671 --> 00:45:12,671
Are you okay?

720
00:45:12,755 --> 00:45:14,875
- Stay calm. We'll get you out now.
- Hurry up!

721
00:45:20,838 --> 00:45:22,546
That is normal.

722
00:45:22,755 --> 00:45:25,296
- That is normal.
- Old man, quick on feet.

723
00:45:36,588 --> 00:45:38,463
Boss, the Lighter Core works

724
00:45:40,421 --> 00:45:41,505
Fuck you!

725
00:45:41,588 --> 00:45:44,213
Are you still hauling
this damned ball now?

726
00:45:45,755 --> 00:45:48,630
This is the last Lighter Core
intended for Hangzhou.

727
00:45:49,338 --> 00:45:51,130
We lost all our units.

728
00:45:51,463 --> 00:45:53,421
This Lighter Core is Hangzhou's only hope.

729
00:45:53,505 --> 00:45:54,630
Nice speech,

730
00:45:55,130 --> 00:45:57,588
but what about my two grandkids?

731
00:46:10,380 --> 00:46:12,755
Boss, this building looks intact.

732
00:46:13,171 --> 00:46:14,755
We can try to climb up from inside.

733
00:46:15,505 --> 00:46:16,338
Good.

734
00:46:16,421 --> 00:46:17,963
Let's get the Lighter Core out now.

735
00:46:49,671 --> 00:46:52,630
- Liu Zi, find a way out.
- Roger.

736
00:46:58,713 --> 00:47:00,963
<i>Gang Zi, Zhou Qian. Load the Lighter Core.</i>

737
00:47:09,130 --> 00:47:10,130
Hold on.

738
00:47:11,505 --> 00:47:12,505
Load people first.

739
00:47:16,588 --> 00:47:19,213
Load... people.

740
00:47:24,046 --> 00:47:26,772
<i>Stop wasting time.
Load the Lighter Core and people together!</i>

741
00:47:30,463 --> 00:47:32,796
Slow down. I've become acrophobic.

742
00:47:40,838 --> 00:47:42,880
Boss, I found an opening.

743
00:47:43,046 --> 00:47:45,463
We can't use dynamite here!
This building is crumbling!

744
00:47:50,588 --> 00:47:53,296
Chui Zi, Liu Zi.
You'll have to find a way out. Go!

745
00:47:54,755 --> 00:47:56,463
Ya Tou, you take over.

746
00:48:07,880 --> 00:48:10,296
Hu Kou! Grandpa! Hurry up!

747
00:48:11,838 --> 00:48:14,046
Gang Zi, report position of Lighter Core.

748
00:48:14,130 --> 00:48:15,255
Fiftieth floor.

749
00:48:15,380 --> 00:48:16,421
Below Han Ziang!

750
00:48:22,088 --> 00:48:22,921
Here!

751
00:48:23,005 --> 00:48:24,005
Here it is!

752
00:48:24,588 --> 00:48:27,255
- Right here! The thinnest part!
- Thin?

753
00:48:27,338 --> 00:48:29,298
- Good thing. I'll leave this to you.
- Okay.

754
00:48:52,255 --> 00:48:54,546
The pulley can't hold any longer!

755
00:48:54,630 --> 00:48:55,671
Pull up the Lighter Core!

756
00:48:55,755 --> 00:48:58,546
- Are you okay, old man?
- Leave me! Pull up quickly!

757
00:49:04,005 --> 00:49:06,588
- Wang Lei! Pull my grandpa up!
- Go up quickly.

758
00:49:07,088 --> 00:49:08,921
Gang Zi! Your position!

759
00:49:09,921 --> 00:49:12,338
The Lighter Core is now at the 75th floor.

760
00:49:20,463 --> 00:49:21,463
Old man!

761
00:49:38,546 --> 00:49:40,463
Get up here, you old man!

762
00:49:50,796 --> 00:49:52,963
Wang Lei, I can't hold it anymore!

763
00:49:56,755 --> 00:49:59,213
Old man! Old man!

764
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:17,130
Let me go, kid.

765
00:50:20,171 --> 00:50:21,713
Grandpa!

766
00:50:22,088 --> 00:50:24,338
Grandpa!

767
00:50:24,421 --> 00:50:25,546
Gang Zi!

768
00:50:45,796 --> 00:50:46,796
Boss.

769
00:50:47,046 --> 00:50:48,088
Gang Zi is gone.

770
00:51:16,255 --> 00:51:17,255
Step out of it.

771
00:51:17,505 --> 00:51:18,588
Han Ziang is gone.

772
00:51:18,671 --> 00:51:19,711
Get those two out of here.

773
00:51:20,671 --> 00:51:21,671
Liu Qi.

774
00:51:22,546 --> 00:51:24,171
- Duoduo, let's move.
- Liu Qi.

775
00:51:24,463 --> 00:51:25,838
- Liu Qi.
- Come on!

776
00:51:29,463 --> 00:51:30,463
Hu Kou.

777
00:51:30,963 --> 00:51:31,963
Hu Kou.

778
00:51:32,255 --> 00:51:33,588
Are you and Duoduo...

779
00:51:34,213 --> 00:51:35,296
safe?

780
00:51:38,963 --> 00:51:39,880
Old man.

781
00:51:39,963 --> 00:51:41,088
Move.

782
00:51:41,255 --> 00:51:42,671
Where are you, old man?

783
00:51:42,838 --> 00:51:44,338
I'm going to get you.

784
00:51:44,421 --> 00:51:46,005
Grandpa!

785
00:51:46,088 --> 00:51:47,713
Grandpa!

786
00:51:47,796 --> 00:51:50,921
I'm sorry, Grandpa.

787
00:52:02,505 --> 00:52:04,921
Hu Kou, save Grandpa!

788
00:52:05,005 --> 00:52:07,088
Liu Qi, you save Grandpa!

789
00:52:42,463 --> 00:52:46,213
<i>On the 17th day
after the Earth stopped spinning,</i>

790
00:52:46,796 --> 00:52:48,838
<i>I saved a child.</i>

791
00:52:49,796 --> 00:52:53,838
<i>She was handed over to me
by countless hands.</i>

792
00:52:57,005 --> 00:52:59,921
<i>I really don't know who her parents were.</i>

793

<i>Every soul under the water</i>

794
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:06,838
<i>is her mother and father.</i>

795
00:53:10,630 --> 00:53:12,838
<i>I named her Han Duoduo.</i>

796
00:53:14,921 --> 00:53:17,213
<i>I named her after my daughter.</i>

797
00:53:17,546 --> 00:53:19,838
- Grandpa!
- I am so sorry, old man!

798
00:53:19,921 --> 00:53:21,296
<i>My grandchildren...</i>

799
00:53:21,588 --> 00:53:23,213
<i>- don't be afraid.</i>
- Come up now!

800
00:53:23,296 --> 00:53:24,296
<i>From then on,</i>

801
00:53:24,671 --> 00:53:26,338
<i>we are a family.</i>

802
00:53:37,880 --> 00:53:39,088
<i>Hu Kou.</i>

803
00:53:40,088 --> 00:53:41,588
<i>As a brother...</i>

804
00:53:43,046 --> 00:53:46,255
- <i>you have to watch over your sister.</i>
- Old man!

805
00:53:46,838 --> 00:53:48,463
<i>Take Duoduo home.</i>

806
00:54:00,296 --> 00:54:01,796
Grandpa!

807
00:54:02,005 --> 00:54:03,171
- Grandpa!
- Duoduo.

808
00:54:03,630 --> 00:54:04,939
- It's dangerous.
- Duoduo!

809
00:54:04,963 --> 00:54:06,505
- Step back.
- Duoduo!

810
00:54:08,296 --> 00:54:10,588
Grandpa.

811
00:54:10,671 --> 00:54:12,213
Why didn't you save my grandpa?

812
00:54:19,546 --> 00:54:20,755
This is our fate!

813
00:54:21,046 --> 00:54:23,130
Let my brother go!

814
00:54:24,046 --> 00:54:25,046
Duoduo.

815
00:54:27,421 --> 00:54:30,088
- Chui Zi. Ya Tou, take them away.
- Yes, sir.

816
00:54:33,380 --> 00:54:36,046
- Don't touch her!
- Duoduo, it's dangerous.

817
00:54:36,255 --> 00:54:37,255
Stop moving.

818
00:54:39,505 --> 00:54:41,630
You will both freeze to death here!

819
00:54:42,046 --> 00:54:44,005
I'm not leaving with you.

820
00:54:44,088 --> 00:54:46,088
I'm going home with my brother.

821
00:54:46,171 --> 00:54:48,671
Boss, marching to Hangzhou at full speed,

822
00:54:48,755 --> 00:54:49,921
will take three hours...

823
00:54:50,005 --> 00:54:51,588
Transporter is gone.

824
00:54:53,380 --> 00:54:55,963
So, I'm no longer useful

825
00:54:56,755 --> 00:54:57,755
to you.

826
00:55:02,171 --> 00:55:04,171
Give them supplies
and the navigation device.

827
00:55:04,463 --> 00:55:05,296
Let's move!

828
00:55:05,380 --> 00:55:06,671
Let's rush to Hangzhou.

829
00:55:07,088 --> 00:55:08,338
Duoduo, let's go home.

830
00:55:10,796 --> 00:55:13,421
Grandpa is gone.

831
00:55:13,588 --> 00:55:16,546
Where is our home?

Liu Peiqiang.

852
00:56:45,671 --> 00:56:46,963
What are you doing?

853
00:56:47,046 --> 00:56:50,213
The space station has broken free!
Earth's communications will be paralyzed.

854
00:56:50,755 --> 00:56:52,296
People on Earth are abandoned.

855
00:56:52,505 --> 00:56:53,838
My son is still out there!

856
00:56:53,921 --> 00:56:55,921
Have you lost your mind?
Because of your son?

857
00:56:56,005 --> 00:56:57,671
We're in a low consumption mode.

858
00:56:57,755 --> 00:57:00,130
You'll be handed over
to the military court!

859
00:57:00,213 --> 00:57:01,796
Low consumption mode is a ruse!

860
00:57:01,921 --> 00:57:02,921
See for yourself.

861
00:57:05,630 --> 00:57:07,588
Perhaps MOSS is malfunctioning.

862
00:57:08,671 --> 00:57:09,951
It's insubordination.

863
00:57:12,213 --> 00:57:13,733
What are you planning to do?

864
00:57:14,755 --> 00:57:16,272
Head to the central control module.

865
00:57:16,296 --> 00:57:17,338
Stop the space station.

866
00:57:20,546 --> 00:57:22,130
<i>All violators,</i>

867
00:57:22,213 --> 00:57:24,338
<i>stop contact immediately with Earth</i>

868
00:57:24,421 --> 00:57:26,338
<i>and return to hibernation area.</i>

869
00:57:26,963 --> 00:57:28,213
<i>Lieutenant Peiqiang...</i>

870
00:57:28,338 --> 00:57:32,296
Liu, are you absolutely sure
we have to go through the airlock?

871
00:57:32,380 --> 00:57:33,380
Makarov,

872
00:57:33,921 --> 00:57:35,241
maybe you shouldn't come with me.

873
00:57:36,338 --> 00:57:38,213
You won't make it without me, Peiqiang.

874
00:57:38,296 --> 00:57:41,796
Plus, let me ask you, do you think
you know the exterior like I do?

875
00:57:41,880 --> 00:57:45,463
Don't forget, we Russians invented
space station 100 years ago.

876
00:57:49,880 --> 00:57:51,713
The airlock wasn't designed for exiting.

877
00:57:51,796 --> 00:57:53,716
Are you sure this is going to work?

878
00:57:54,505 --> 00:57:55,630
I'm sure.

879
00:57:58,380 --> 00:58:01,213
We want to take our kids
fishing on Lake Baikal.

880
00:58:01,296 --> 00:58:03,463
I'd rather have hotpot in Chongqing.

881
00:58:05,380 --> 00:58:07,460
<i>The central
control module is approaching.</i>

882
00:58:10,588 --> 00:58:13,463
Russian cosmonauts are invincible!

883
00:58:17,588 --> 00:58:19,546
Grab me on to me, Makarov!

884
00:58:19,630 --> 00:58:21,130
I don't want to die!

885
00:58:23,755 --> 00:58:24,588
Makarov!

886
00:58:24,671 --> 00:58:26,880
Quick! Pull quickly!
Pull quickly!

887
00:58:29,046 --> 00:58:30,838
Go!

888
00:58:36,421 --> 00:58:38,796
I'd rather sleep in the hibernation unit.

889
00:58:40,005 --> 00:58:42,796
Jupiter has captured Earth's atmosphere.

890
00:58:45,588 --> 00:58:47,463
<i>Oh, my god!</i>

891
00:58:53,755 --> 00:58:54,755
<i>Over there!</i>

892
00:58:55,296 --> 00:58:57,046
<i>The distress signal is coming from there.</i>

893
00:59:00,130 --> 00:59:02,338
Even air rescue's plane has crashed.

894
00:59:12,463 --> 00:59:14,463
- An intact transporter.
- Yeah.

895
00:59:15,463 --> 00:59:17,463
It could be the source
of the distress signal.

896
00:59:18,921 --> 00:59:20,147
I'll check the transporter.

897
00:59:20,171 --> 00:59:21,338
You go onboard for shelter.

898
00:59:21,421 --> 00:59:23,046
Search for anything useful.

899
00:59:30,463 --> 00:59:32,064
Anybody, come help!

900
00:59:32,088 --> 00:59:33,408
- Let go of me!
- Liu Qi!

901
00:59:34,296 --> 00:59:35,546
Pull her!

902
00:59:36,088 --> 00:59:37,505
I'm going to kill her!

903
00:59:41,005 --> 00:59:42,605
Come here, quick!

904
00:59:43,088 --> 00:59:44,338
You! Calm down!

905
00:59:44,421 --> 00:59:45,939
We are a rescue unit.

906
00:59:53,588 --> 00:59:54,588
It's okay.

907
00:59:54,630 --> 00:59:56,755
Calm down. Calm down.

908
01:00:05,796 --> 01:00:07,588
The mission of our rescue unit

909
01:00:07,671 --> 01:00:09,671
is to restart the Torque Engines
along the equator.

910
01:00:10,671 --> 01:00:13,231
But Jupiter's gravitational force
has thinned out our atmosphere.

911
01:00:14,546 --> 01:00:16,171
The aircraft can't fly anymore.

912
01:00:16,255 --> 01:00:18,505
I don't know
how many aircrafts had survived.

913
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:19,880
Thank you.

914
01:00:20,505 --> 01:00:22,671
Calm yourself. Talk to us after you eat.

915
01:00:24,046 --> 01:00:25,713
Huh?

916
01:00:25,796 --> 01:00:28,421
Why is there a foreigner
in a Chinese rescue unit?

917
01:00:28,505 --> 01:00:29,755
Who's a foreigner?

918
01:00:29,838 --> 01:00:31,338
My father is from Beijing.

919
01:00:31,963 --> 01:00:33,630
I am an authentic...

920
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:36,505
Chinaman.

921
01:00:38,088 --> 01:00:39,880

922
01:00:39,963 --> 01:00:41,296
Well, that's good news.

923
01:00:41,380 --> 01:00:42,463
We can go home.

924
01:00:43,630 --> 01:00:45,463
Man, you can operate it?

925
01:00:46,755 --> 01:00:48,046
Yes. And?

926
01:00:50,421 --> 01:00:53,338
Everyone. We've got to hurry.

940
01:01:37,380 --> 01:01:39,838
The engines along the equator
are the more important.

941
01:01:39,921 --> 01:01:41,641
It'll take more than ten hours

Huang Ming! Huang Ming!

959
01:03:09,046 --> 01:03:11,397
Check the status
of the Lighter Core, and keep moving.

960
01:03:11,421 --> 01:03:13,939
- Boss! Boss, we no longer have a target.
- Keep moving, am I clear?

961
01:03:13,963 --> 01:03:15,147
- Step aside.
- What's the point?

962
01:03:15,171 --> 01:03:16,046
- Why?
- This Lighter Core is the only hope

and all those lives of our rescue unit
have died in vain.

01:04:48,296 --> 01:04:49,630
Think very carefully.

976
01:04:50,171 --> 01:04:52,213
It's our only chance to go home.

977
01:04:54,546 --> 01:04:55,546
What?

978
01:04:55,838 --> 01:04:56,880
No one is forcing you.

979
01:04:57,421 --> 01:04:59,255
You can switch with them anytime.

980
01:05:04,796 --> 01:05:08,588
Attention to all members
of rescue unit CN171-11.

981

985
01:05:19,171 --> 01:05:20,463
Boss, where are you going?

986
01:05:29,255 --> 01:05:31,838
There is a Lighter Core onboard.

987
01:05:31,963 --> 01:05:34,380
<i>Rescue unit CN171-11.</i>

988

<i>Please assist us to rescue Sulawesi.</i>

989
01:05:53,755 --> 01:05:57,130
Everyone, our mission is to restart
Sulawesi 03 Torque Engine.

990
01:05:57,213 --> 01:05:59,338
Only a handful of Lighter Core
can make it now.

991
01:05:59,421 --> 01:06:01,213
The survival of Earth depends on us.

992
01:06:01,838 --> 01:06:04,213
Who are you? Where are you coming from?

993
01:06:04,296 --> 01:06:05,296
Li Yiyi.

994
01:06:05,338 --> 01:06:08,046
- Emergency technical observer of UEG.
- Oh.

995
01:06:08,130 --> 01:06:10,046
What a high rank
for someone so young.

996
01:06:15,963 --> 01:06:17,088
When this is over,

997
01:06:18,046 --> 01:06:21,380
I will settle the score,
for my grandpa, with you.

998
01:06:30,546 --> 01:06:31,755
Head South.

999
01:06:32,296 --> 01:06:33,630
We're going to Sulawesi.

1000
01:06:51,880 --> 01:06:55,130
<i>Will all violators
stop contact immediately with Earth</i>

1001
01:06:55,213 --> 01:06:57,671
<i>and return to hibernation area?</i>

1002
01:06:59,380 --> 01:07:01,005
I've got to correct you.

1003
01:07:01,088 --> 01:07:03,046
It will take more than 2,500 years

1004
01:07:03,130 --> 01:07:04,963
for frozen Lake Baikal to liquefy.

1005
01:07:05,046 --> 01:07:06,171
That's okay.

1006
01:07:06,755 --> 01:07:08,046
We have children,

1007
01:07:08,588 --> 01:07:10,713
and their children will have children.

1008
01:07:11,296 --> 01:07:14,213
There'll be a day
that ice turns into water.

1009
01:07:16,838 --> 01:07:20,630
There's another 20
to 30 meters until A3 intersection.

1010
01:07:24,380 --> 01:07:26,963
Look! A1 intersection exploded.

1011
01:07:27,796 --> 01:07:30,796
Maybe there are others
who knew about the insubordination too.

1012
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:34,463
And they are trying to make their way
to the central control module.

1013
01:07:34,546 --> 01:07:36,130
Makarov, stay close to me!

1014
01:07:36,213 --> 01:07:37,838
Hurry! Climb quickly!

1015
01:07:43,088 --> 01:07:44,296
Watch out!

1016
01:07:53,755 --> 01:07:55,088
Makarov!

1017
01:07:55,171 --> 01:07:58,005
Somebody help me! I want to go home!

1018
01:08:07,380 --> 01:08:08,713
Liu Peiqiang!

1019
01:08:08,796 --> 01:08:11,255
Just one more cabin
till the A3 intersection.

1020
01:08:11,338 --> 01:08:12,755
Let's jump! We can do it!

1021
01:08:13,838 --> 01:08:16,546
The central control module's approaching.

1022
01:08:17,421 --> 01:08:18,838
Jump!

1023

<i>...when ice turns into water.</i>

1031

1032
01:09:06,338 --> 01:09:08,505
<i>to go salmon fishing.</i>

1033

Once crossed...

1050
01:11:15,838 --> 01:11:17,046
it's the dark side of Earth.

That's a big fellow.

Is that a whale?

1067
01:12:08,755 --> 01:12:09,755
Maybe.

1068
01:12:11,838 --> 01:12:13,005
Why is it here?

1069
01:12:14,046 --> 01:12:15,671
It had swam this far.

1070
01:12:15,755 --> 01:12:16,915
It was probably heading home.

1071
01:12:18,046 --> 01:12:19,088
Heading home?

1072
01:12:20,171 --> 01:12:23,546
Once the mission is completed,
you can reunite with your father.

1073
01:12:25,213 --> 01:12:26,463
When I was a child,

1074
01:12:26,546 --> 01:12:29,963
someone told me that
he is just like a star in the sky.

1075
01:12:30,671 --> 01:12:32,463
When I lift my head, I'll see him.

1076
01:12:34,171 --> 01:12:36,630
Later, I realized it was all lies,
you know?

1077
01:12:36,713 --> 01:12:37,713
In Beijing...

1078
01:12:38,921 --> 01:12:40,796
it's impossible to see the stars.

1079
01:12:42,463 --> 01:12:44,296
Actually, in my heart...

1080
01:12:45,963 --> 01:12:48,255
that star no longer exists.

1081
01:12:49,755 --> 01:12:52,380
Grandpa told me
to watch over my sister...

1082
01:12:53,046 --> 01:12:54,296
and take Duoduo home.

1083
01:12:56,296 --> 01:12:57,380
I'll do that.

1084
01:12:58,463 --> 01:12:59,713
I'll take Duoduo home.

1085
01:13:04,380 --> 01:13:05,880

1091

<i>Once the readings rise back to normal,</i>

1093

<i>The UEG was informed,</i>

<i>but still chose to perform

1099
01:13:56,005 --> 01:13:58,921
<i>But this mission was predetermined
to be futile.</i>

1100

<i>The evacuation of the space station</i>

Stop robbing us!

1133
01:15:33,796 --> 01:15:36,338
We're all dying! We're all dying!

1134
01:15:36,421 --> 01:15:38,546
<i>You are all heroes of the Earth.</i>

1135
01:15:38,713 --> 01:15:41,713
<i>We will forever remember to honor you.</i>

1136
01:15:42,463 --> 01:15:45,171
<i>We will shoulder your aspirations</i>

1137
01:15:45,255 --> 01:15:47,255
<i>and send it to our new home</i>

1138
01:15:47,338 --> 01:15:49,755
<i>in 2,500 years.</i>

1139
01:15:49,880 --> 01:15:52,088
<i>Everything will come to an end...</i>

1140
01:15:52,630 --> 01:15:53,755
<i>in the last seven days</i>

1141
01:15:53,838 --> 01:15:56,130
<i>before Earth collides with Jupiter.</i>

1142
01:15:56,213 --> 01:15:58,255
<i>Let us go home.</i>

1143
01:15:58,338 --> 01:16:00,098
<i>Hug your parents.</i>

1144
01:16:00,671 --> 01:16:03,671
<i>Kiss your beloved partner and children.</i>

1145
01:16:04,171 --> 01:16:07,838
<i>Gather with your family
for a proper goodbye.</i>

1146
01:16:07,921 --> 01:16:09,630
<i>Good luck to you.</i>

1147
01:16:09,713 --> 01:16:11,272
<i>End of broadcasting.</i>

1148
01:16:11,296 --> 01:16:12,296
<i>Farewell.</i>

1149
01:16:13,921 --> 01:16:15,671
Hu Kou, I wanna go home.

1150
01:16:21,046 --> 01:16:24,046
Seven days, where? Yeah, right!

1151
01:16:25,130 --> 01:16:28,588
Within a day,
our atmosphere would be drained empty.

1152
01:16:28,671 --> 01:16:31,130
Everyone will die of asphyxiation.

1153
01:16:31,213 --> 01:16:34,255
Where are the seven days
you were talking about?

1154
01:16:34,338 --> 01:16:38,463
CN171-11, all members move
immediately onboard.

1155
01:16:41,713 --> 01:16:42,838
Ready to evacuate.

1156
01:16:43,338 --> 01:16:45,463
Screw you, damn Jupiter!

1157
01:16:45,546 --> 01:16:47,421
Screw you, Jupiter!

1158
01:16:52,880 --> 01:16:55,338
<i>Please get ready,
Lieutenant Colonel Liu Peiqiang.</i>

1159
01:16:55,421 --> 01:16:58,546
<i>MOSS will assist your return
to the backup hibernation unit.</i>

1160
01:17:04,671 --> 01:17:08,046
MOSS, this is an emergency communication.

1161
01:17:08,463 --> 01:17:12,130
Code number 5711 62310.

1162
01:17:13,088 --> 01:17:15,296
Let me speak to my son one last time.

1163
01:17:20,005 --> 01:17:22,463
<i>Liu Qi is not in his assigned area.</i>

1164
01:17:22,546 --> 01:17:24,421
<i>Connection unavailable.</i>

1165
01:17:24,505 --> 01:17:27,046
<i>Han Ziang is not in his assigned area.</i>

1166
01:17:27,130 --> 01:17:28,671
<i>Connection unavailable.</i>

1167
01:17:28,755 --> 01:17:30,755
<i>Wang Lei is not in his assigned area.</i>

1168
01:17:30,838 --> 01:17:32,171
<i>Connection unavailable.</i>

1169
01:17:32,255 --> 01:17:35,046
<i>Contact with Transporter 373 was lost.</i>

1170
01:17:35,130 --> 01:17:37,630
<i>Its last transmission
was from Shanghai area.</i>

1171
01:17:38,296 --> 01:17:41,005
<i>I can no longer recall your face,
you bastard.</i>

1172
01:17:42,671 --> 01:17:44,380
<i>Jupiter is right in front of me.</i>

1173
01:17:45,796 --> 01:17:47,088
<i>When are you coming back?</i>

1174
01:17:48,588 --> 01:17:51,505
<i>From the day
the Wandering Earth Project initiated,</i>

1175
01:17:52,463 --> 01:17:53,921
<i>there was no turning back.</i>

1176
01:18:02,171 --> 01:18:03,546
<i>Hey.</i>

1177
01:18:03,630 --> 01:18:04,796
<i>Look, look.</i>

1178
01:18:04,880 --> 01:18:05,880
<i>It's Jupiter.</i>

1179
01:18:06,130 --> 01:18:08,338
<i>The largest planet in the Solar System.</i>

1180
01:18:08,421 --> 01:18:11,421
<i>Daddy, there's an eye on Jupiter.</i>

1181
01:18:11,505 --> 01:18:12,838
<i>That's not an eye.</i>

1182
01:18:13,296 --> 01:18:15,171
<i>That's a huge windstorm on Jupiter.</i>

1183
01:18:16,880 --> 01:18:19,963
<i>Jupiter is like a huge balloon...</i>

1184
01:18:23,171 --> 01:18:24,588
<i>composed of 90 percent...</i>

1185
01:18:24,671 --> 01:18:25,713
<i>Hydrogen.</i>

1186
01:18:34,171 --> 01:18:35,171
Li Yiyi!

1187
01:18:35,255 --> 01:18:37,296
If we mix Jupiter's
and Earth's atmospheres,

1188
01:18:37,380 --> 01:18:38,546
<i>is that combustible?</i>

1189
01:18:43,130 --> 01:18:46,338
<i>By now, Jupiter has siphoned
at least 30 billion liters of oxygen.</i>

1190
01:18:46,421 --> 01:18:48,755
<i>The combustion shockwave
will be over Mach 1,000.</i>

1191
01:18:48,838 --> 01:18:51,606
<i>The generated force
will be sufficient to push Earth away.</i>

1192
01:18:51,630 --> 01:18:54,421
A hydrogen-oxygen mixture can be ignited
with a single match.

1193
01:18:54,505 --> 01:18:55,921
All we need now is a match.

1194
01:18:56,338 --> 01:19:00,005
No, no, the distance between planets
is over 70,000 kilometers.

1195
01:19:00,088 --> 01:19:02,213
Even ballistic missiles
can't reach that far!

1196
01:19:03,046 --> 01:19:04,046
Li Yiyi.

1197
01:19:04,755 --> 01:19:05,838
What about this match?

1198
01:19:05,921 --> 01:19:07,005
What match?

1199
01:19:14,046 --> 01:19:16,005
I can modify
the engine's operating system...

1200
01:19:16,630 --> 01:19:18,005
I can blast the beam much higher!

1201
01:19:21,338 --> 01:19:25,546
Wang Lei, Jupiter's combustion shockwave
can propel Earth out from Jupiter.

1202
01:19:27,338 --> 01:19:28,463
Yes, I'm listening.

1203
01:19:29,088 --> 01:19:29,921
No need to yell.

1204
01:19:30,005 --> 01:19:32,755
Come on. Let's light up Jupiter!

1205
01:19:35,005 --> 01:19:37,213
That's a suicide mission.

1206
01:19:37,921 --> 01:19:40,546
Yes, but it's much better
than waiting to die.

1207
01:19:41,296 --> 01:19:42,838
Anyone wanna quit?

1208
01:20:00,796 --> 01:20:04,255
<i>The Helios Project's
evacuation procedure is initiated.</i>

1209
01:20:18,671 --> 01:20:21,755
<i>All rescue units...
All rescue units are evacuating.</i>

1210
01:20:21,838 --> 01:20:24,564
<i>Calling Navigation
Platform International Space Station.</i>

1211
01:20:24,588 --> 01:20:26,171
<i>Do you copy?</i>

1212
01:20:26,255 --> 01:20:28,755
Repeat, calling Navigation Platform
Space Station.

1213
01:20:28,838 --> 01:20:30,130
We came up with a new plan.

1214
01:20:30,213 --> 01:20:31,338
Please respond.

1215
01:20:31,838 --> 01:20:33,421
All communications have been blocked.

1216
01:20:34,255 --> 01:20:35,272
Attention, everyone.

1217
01:20:35,296 --> 01:20:37,171
We only have 30 minutes left.

1218
01:20:37,255 --> 01:20:38,838
This mission has three steps.

1219
01:20:38,921 --> 01:20:41,046
Step one. Shut the engine down
to gain control.

1220
01:20:42,546 --> 01:20:44,397
There's seven nozzles
in an Earth Engine.

1221
01:20:44,421 --> 01:20:48,005
I'll shut down the engine temporarily
and direct all energy into one nozzle

1222
01:20:48,088 --> 01:20:50,713
to generate a plasma beam
that would reach high enough.

1223
01:20:50,921 --> 01:20:53,088
Does anyone recall
the <i>12 Chimes of Spring</i> festival?

1224
01:20:55,255 --> 01:20:56,255
I wrote that program.

1225
01:20:57,630 --> 01:20:59,171
<i>Happy New Year!</i>

1226
01:21:00,963 --> 01:21:02,323
- That was you...
- Boring, I know.

1227
01:21:02,921 --> 01:21:05,202
I'll use it to override the system
so we can have control.

1228
01:21:05,463 --> 01:21:07,671
Step two. Once we override the system,

1229
01:21:07,755 --> 01:21:11,088
the auto-unlock mechanism won't work.
So, it has to be unlocked manually.

1230
01:21:11,171 --> 01:21:15,130
Captain Wang and Antenna,
Scarface and Band-Aid.

1231
01:21:16,130 --> 01:21:17,796
- Well, my name is...
- Whatever.

1232
01:21:18,796 --> 01:21:21,077
- The manual unlocking depends on you.
- Pretty cool, huh?

1233
01:21:22,338 --> 01:21:25,755
The last step. Put the Lighter Core
into the reaction chamber,

1234
01:21:25,838 --> 01:21:27,046
reignite the Earth Engine.

1235
01:21:30,630 --> 01:21:32,856
Blast the plasma beam
70,000 kilometers into space

1236
01:21:32,880 --> 01:21:33,880
and light up Jupiter.

1237
01:21:33,921 --> 01:21:36,481
The combustion shockwave will travel along
the atmospheric transference,

1238
01:21:36,505 --> 01:21:38,505
boom, propelling Earth away.
Get it for me, please.

1239
01:21:38,838 --> 01:21:41,921
Liu Qi, you'll drive the Lighter Core
to the reaction chamber.

1240
01:21:42,005 --> 01:21:43,588
Installation procedure, uh...

1241
01:21:43,671 --> 01:21:44,796
is basically automatic.

1242
01:21:44,880 --> 01:21:47,588
Hey, China man. You go, you go with him.

1243
01:21:47,671 --> 01:21:49,088
Why am I involved?

1244
01:21:49,171 --> 01:21:50,463
Are you kidding?

1245
01:21:50,546 --> 01:21:53,463
Installing a Lighter Core
requires a minimum of 13 months training.

1246
01:21:53,546 --> 01:21:54,838
Wanna take this place?

1247
01:21:56,505 --> 01:21:57,731
Once the mission is accomplished,

1248
01:21:57,755 --> 01:22:00,005
we all head
to the underground city immediately.

1249
01:22:00,088 --> 01:22:02,255
This wave will definitely be a very...

1250
01:22:03,963 --> 01:22:05,088
a very...

1251
01:22:06,380 --> 01:22:07,505
humongous.

1252
01:22:08,880 --> 01:22:10,630
This is a make or break move.

1253
01:22:10,713 --> 01:22:12,130
Succeed or die, any questions?

1254
01:22:12,213 --> 01:22:13,213
I...

1255
01:22:13,713 --> 01:22:14,713
Perfect.

1256
01:22:17,463 --> 01:22:18,463
Hey.

1257
01:22:20,046 --> 01:22:21,046
There.

1258
01:22:22,005 --> 01:22:23,338
It's the control center.

1259
01:22:28,921 --> 01:22:30,981
<i>Attention, all evacuating rescue units.</i>

1260
01:22:31,005 --> 01:22:32,005
<i>We need your assistance.</i>

1261
01:22:32,046 --> 01:22:33,546
<i>Please slow down and stop.</i>

1262
01:22:33,630 --> 01:22:34,838
<i>We need your support.</i>

1263
01:22:34,921 --> 01:22:36,505
<i>Please slow down and stop.</i>

1264
01:22:45,130 --> 01:22:47,713
Looks like we are on our own now.

1265
01:22:51,755 --> 01:22:53,171
Oh, mighty Newton.

1266
01:22:53,255 --> 01:22:55,005
Enlighted Einstein.

1267
01:22:55,380 --> 01:22:56,713
Holy Hawking.

1268
01:22:56,796 --> 01:22:58,171
Also, Amitabha Buddha.

1269
01:22:58,255 --> 01:22:59,755
Gang Zi will bless us.

1270
01:23:01,005 --> 01:23:02,565
I learned the installation procedure...

1271
01:23:03,421 --> 01:23:04,796
during my internship.

1272
01:23:06,088 --> 01:23:08,838
Don't forget, your brother is a genius.

1273
01:23:09,088 --> 01:23:10,130
He's a genius.

1274
01:23:44,296 --> 01:23:46,213
Wait. This is an emergency mission.

1275
01:23:46,296 --> 01:23:47,380
We need your help.

1276
01:23:48,463 --> 01:23:49,713
I'm sorry, but it's all over.

1277
01:23:49,796 --> 01:23:51,130
I don't care about your mission.

1278
01:23:51,213 --> 01:23:53,189
- I wanna leave in one piece.
- Please you gotta help us.

1279
01:23:53,213 --> 01:23:55,255
Evacuate, it's too dangerous.

1280
01:23:58,671 --> 01:23:59,671
Over here.

1281
01:24:00,963 --> 01:24:03,713
Captain Wang. We're counting on you.

1282
01:24:03,796 --> 01:24:06,838
Don't worry. Zhou Qian, take Duoduo
upstairs call for backup.

1283
01:24:06,921 --> 01:24:07,963
Roger.

1284
01:24:08,630 --> 01:24:10,921
Duoduo, let's go.

1285
01:24:40,005 --> 01:24:41,755
The Earth Engine has been shut down.

1286
01:24:45,421 --> 01:24:47,671
All right, men, let's hit it.

1287
01:24:49,380 --> 01:24:51,147
<i>It's fully automatic!
What are you browsing at?</i>

1288
01:24:51,171 --> 01:24:53,147
<i>Why is the manual so thick
if it's automatic?</i>

1289
01:24:54,338 --> 01:24:55,546
What are you doing?

1290
01:24:56,296 --> 01:24:57,338
Shit!

1291
01:24:57,421 --> 01:24:58,963
I'm trying to figure it out!

1292
01:24:59,046 --> 01:25:00,838
Wire cores without color markings.

1293
01:25:00,921 --> 01:25:03,546
They need to be in sequence.
Everything is in gray.

1294
01:25:04,463 --> 01:25:07,463
This is for the transporter's broadcast.
This is for connecting up there.

1295
01:25:07,546 --> 01:25:08,380
Press to speak.

1296
01:25:08,463 --> 01:25:11,046
- Huh? What's up there?
- Space station.

1297
01:25:15,921 --> 01:25:16,921
Come on. Next.

1298
01:25:18,005 --> 01:25:20,463
Uploading trojan
<i>12 Chimes of Spring</i> festival.

1299
01:25:45,338 --> 01:25:47,796
Requesting unit CN171-11.

<i>We're executing our last rescue mission.</i>

1302
01:25:52,838 --> 01:25:53,755
- <i>Requesting support.</i>
- I don't understand.

1303
01:25:53,838 --> 01:25:55,380
Why are these people still trying?

1304
01:25:55,463 --> 01:25:57,505
It's a waste of time. Don't bother.

1305
01:25:59,463 --> 01:26:01,671
Unit CN171-11.

1306
01:26:01,755 --> 01:26:03,755
<i>We have one last rescue plan.</i>

1307
01:26:03,838 --> 01:26:06,338
Requesting support, requesting support!

1308
01:26:07,213 --> 01:26:09,963
<i>We're the rescue unit CN171-11.</i>

1309
01:26:10,046 --> 01:26:12,189
<i>We still have one last rescue mission.</i>

1310
01:26:12,213 --> 01:26:13,088
- <i>Requesting support...</i>
- Would be great...

1311
01:26:13,171 --> 01:26:15,251
- <i>...requesting support!</i>
- ...if there was miso soup.

1312
01:26:17,296 --> 01:26:18,856
<i>We're done with the last one.</i>

1313
01:26:18,880 --> 01:26:20,088
<i>What's next?</i>

1314
01:26:20,213 --> 01:26:21,213
Just one moment!

1315
01:26:21,296 --> 01:26:23,005
It should be fully automatic.

1316
01:26:24,880 --> 01:26:26,463
The next step is manual labor.

1317
01:26:26,546 --> 01:26:29,088
The program he wrote
lacked the percussion pin procedure.

1318
01:26:33,713 --> 01:26:35,046
<i>You call this...</i>

1319
01:26:35,796 --> 01:26:37,255
<i>a pin?</i>

1320
01:26:39,671 --> 01:26:41,171
No rescue units responding.

1321
01:26:41,255 --> 01:26:42,895
<i>Nobody is responding.</i>

1322
01:27:08,838 --> 01:27:11,338
What is Error 425?

1323
01:27:11,421 --> 01:27:12,463
What does it mean?

1324
01:27:13,088 --> 01:27:13,963
Li Yiyi!

1325
01:27:14,046 --> 01:27:15,838
How is this fully automatic?

1326
01:27:15,963 --> 01:27:17,296
Didn't I give you the manual?

1327
01:27:17,380 --> 01:27:18,689
- I know, but...
<i>- It's for situations like this.</i>

1328
01:27:18,713 --> 01:27:20,588
I know, but what is Error 425?

1329
01:27:20,671 --> 01:27:21,963
Read it yourself.

1330
01:27:26,005 --> 01:27:28,189
<i>Warning, Han Ziang illegally operating...</i>

1331
01:27:28,213 --> 01:27:30,046
Li Yiyi, you know what, you are...

1332
01:27:32,505 --> 01:27:34,338
Tim. Helmet on!

1333
01:27:34,421 --> 01:27:36,546
- Wait a moment!
- Forget about it!

1334
01:27:50,380 --> 01:27:51,630
Okay, what's next?

1335
01:27:51,713 --> 01:27:54,713
Fully automatic.
It says it's should be fully automatic.

1336
01:28:06,921 --> 01:28:09,046
Why is it stuck here?

1337
01:28:12,505 --> 01:28:14,963
Without a hardware tweak,
you won't be hacking shit. Let me...

1338
01:28:15,046 --> 01:28:16,286
Hu Kou, where are you?

1339
01:28:16,338 --> 01:28:17,755
I'm not getting any response.

1340
01:28:17,921 --> 01:28:19,041
There's enough space behind.

1341
01:28:19,088 --> 01:28:20,963
More fun crossing in front of you.

1342
01:28:21,046 --> 01:28:22,481
We don't have too much time.

1343
01:28:29,921 --> 01:28:32,338
This freaking door is jammed.

1344
01:28:32,421 --> 01:28:33,421
Here.

1345
01:28:46,005 --> 01:28:48,213
<i>Lao He! How can you fix it
without a diagram?</i>

1346
01:28:48,296 --> 01:28:49,380
Shut up. Let me focus.

1347
01:28:49,463 --> 01:28:51,671
The jumpers haven't been touched
in over a decade.

1348
01:28:51,755 --> 01:28:53,921
One mistake, it'll be game over.

1349
01:29:20,130 --> 01:29:22,005
Li Yiyi, the ignitor is ready.

1350
01:29:22,880 --> 01:29:24,921
No. It says installation incomplete.

1351
01:29:25,005 --> 01:29:26,380
Looks like it's almost done.

1352
01:29:38,255 --> 01:29:39,255
Liu Qi!

1353
01:29:40,880 --> 01:29:42,380
Liu Qi! Are you completely crazy?

1354
01:29:42,463 --> 01:29:43,671
Save your nonsense.

1355
01:29:44,171 --> 01:29:45,171
Get out and help.

Band-Aid.

1360
01:31:04,963 --> 01:31:06,546
Duoduo. Can you move?

1361
01:31:07,671 --> 01:31:10,588
One, two, three, hold on!

1362
01:31:13,046 --> 01:31:14,088
Liu Qi!

1363
01:31:15,296 --> 01:31:17,005
Have you found the problem?

1364
01:31:17,671 --> 01:31:19,130
It's stuck inside.

1365
01:31:23,421 --> 01:31:24,505
Li Yiyi.

1366
01:31:24,588 --> 01:31:26,338
You go on. Go!

1367
01:31:27,963 --> 01:31:29,630
- Duoduo, leave me here.
- No.

1368
01:31:29,713 --> 01:31:31,546
Hurry up and evacuate
to the underground city.

1373
01:31:55,130 --> 01:31:56,755
<i>Help!</i>

<i>Hey! Can anyone help us, please?</i>

1376

<i>Please follow MOSS' instructions,
and return to the backup hibernation unit.</i>

<i>It's Han Duoduo.</i>

<i>We still have one last hope.</i>

1381
01:32:33,546 --> 01:32:35,713
Duoduo? Are you okay?

1382
01:32:35,796 --> 01:32:37,116
<i>Is Liu Qi still there?</i>

1383
01:32:37,171 --> 01:32:40,880
We're all here.
We're at Sulawesi 03 Torque Engine.

1384
01:32:41,463 --> 01:32:43,314
<i>We'll ignite Jupiter...</i>

01:32:44,505 --> 01:32:45,505
We're gonna need some...

1387
01:32:45,546 --> 01:32:47,588
<i>Unfortunately, seven hours ago,</i>

1388
01:32:47,671 --> 01:32:51,213
<i>this plan was already proposed
by the Israeli scientists.</i>

1389
01:32:51,296 --> 01:32:53,630
<i>The probability of success is zero.</i>

1390
01:32:54,130 --> 01:32:55,505
Don't worry, Duoduo.

1391
01:32:55,588 --> 01:32:57,338
I will try to contact the UEG.

1392
01:33:01,671 --> 01:33:04,630
<i>Details of the plan have been uploaded.</i>

1393

UEG, I'm Chinese astronaut Liu Peiqiang.

1396
01:33:18,213 --> 01:33:19,397
Please send a global order now

1397
01:33:19,421 --> 01:33:23,755
to deploy all rescue units in the vicinity
of Sulawesi as reinforcements.

1403
01:33:47,005 --> 01:33:48,005
Today...

1404
01:33:49,046 --> 01:33:50,726
it's the first day
of the Chinese New Year.

1405
01:33:52,713 --> 01:33:54,421
It was meant to be a day of reunion.

1406
01:33:57,171 --> 01:33:58,546
As a father,

1407
01:33:58,630 --> 01:34:00,630
I don't want this to be the last reunion.

1408
01:34:01,463 --> 01:34:02,713
I won't give up.

1409
01:34:04,755 --> 01:34:06,546
We have nothing to lose.

1410
01:34:08,171 --> 01:34:09,851
For the sake of our children...

1411
01:34:11,588 --> 01:34:12,671
I'm begging you.

1412
01:34:15,296 --> 01:34:17,505
<i>As a United Earth Government,</i>

1413

<i>we cannot accept your request.</i>

1414
01:34:19,963 --> 01:34:22,713
<i>However, as a private individual,</i>

1415
01:34:23,338 --> 01:34:26,963
<i>I will connect the rescue unit
to the global broadcasting system.</i>

1416
01:34:27,338 --> 01:34:31,463
<i>And the rest will be up to the will
of each individual.</i>

1417
01:34:32,796 --> 01:34:35,022
I don't understand
why should this happen to us?

1418
01:34:35,046 --> 01:34:36,421
Please, help me look...

1419
01:34:36,505 --> 01:34:38,064
- We have no hope to live.
- Please, I can't find...

1420
01:34:38,088 --> 01:34:39,731
- Be careful.
- We have no hope to survive.

1421
01:34:39,755 --> 01:34:41,546
Somebody...

1422
01:34:41,630 --> 01:34:44,213
<i>Hello, personnel from every rescue unit.</i>

1423
01:34:45,338 --> 01:34:46,921
<i>My name is Han Duoduo.</i>

1424
01:34:47,588 --> 01:34:49,838
<i>I'm a middle school student.</i>

<i>My legs are trembling.</i>

1428

01:35:04,880 --> 01:35:07,338
<i>but there is nothing I can do to help!</i>

1430
01:35:08,630 --> 01:35:10,505
Yesterday, my teacher asked us.

1431
01:35:11,088 --> 01:35:12,338
<i>"What is hope?"</i>

1432
01:35:13,088 --> 01:35:14,463
<i>In the past,</i>

1433
01:35:14,921 --> 01:35:17,838
<i>I never, never believed in hope.</i>

1434
01:35:18,755 --> 01:35:20,505
But now, I do believe in hope.

1435
01:35:21,088 --> 01:35:23,755
I believe
that for the times we're living in now,

1436
01:35:24,463 --> 01:35:27,630
<i>hope is precious like a diamond.</i>

1437
01:35:28,755 --> 01:35:30,671
<i>Hope.</i>

1438
01:35:30,755 --> 01:35:33,880
<i>Hope is the only way to guide us home.</i>

1439
01:35:34,963 --> 01:35:37,588
Please come back
and fight together with us.

1440
01:35:37,671 --> 01:35:40,213
Light up Jupiter,
let's all save our planet.

1441
01:35:42,046 --> 01:35:45,463
We located at Sulawesi 03 Torque Engine,

1442
01:35:45,546 --> 01:35:47,630
under the command of Captain Wang Lei.

1443

there'll be nobody, nobody left to see!

Allright, let's go! Let's go!

We're not unlikely

01:41:47,796 --> 01:41:49,005

01:49:50,963 --> 01:49:53,213
I'm heading to the backup elevator
to pick up the others.

1610
01:49:53,296 --> 01:49:54,713
Five minutes left!

1611
01:49:54,796 --> 01:49:56,755
<i>Get down now! This is an order!</i>

1612
01:49:57,046 --> 01:49:58,088
Yes, sir!

1613
01:50:07,130 --> 01:50:08,890
<i>Duoduo! Watch out!</i>

1614
01:50:10,130 --> 01:50:13,338
Boss! Hey, boss! Boss!

1615
01:50:15,171 --> 01:50:16,255
Duoduo!

1616
01:50:17,505 --> 01:50:19,921
She's here!

1617
01:50:22,588 --> 01:50:25,463
- Duoduo.
- Get Duoduo out of here.

1618
01:50:25,546 --> 01:50:27,005
I can't hold on any longer.

1619
01:50:32,296 --> 01:50:33,838
Backup elevator collapsed.

1620
01:50:34,380 --> 01:50:38,046
Li Yiyi, do you have any other way?

1621
01:50:39,463 --> 01:50:41,130
Wang Lei! Wang Lei!

1622
01:50:41,213 --> 01:50:42,671
Li Yiyi.

1623
01:50:42,755 --> 01:50:44,171
Hurry up and think of something!

1624
01:50:46,005 --> 01:50:49,213
Earth Engine!
We can try hiding under the Earth Engine!

1625
01:50:49,296 --> 01:50:52,439
<i>If the thrust of the Earth Engine
can counteract the force of the shockwave,</i>

1626
01:50:52,463 --> 01:50:54,263
- <i>you guys can still stand a chance!</i>
- Liu Qi.

1627
01:50:54,630 --> 01:50:56,046
I cannot get out.

1628
01:50:56,963 --> 01:50:58,130
Go, now.

1629
01:50:58,255 --> 01:50:59,421
Liu Qi!

1630
01:51:00,505 --> 01:51:01,505
Go!

1631
01:51:02,046 --> 01:51:03,421
Hurry!

1632
01:51:17,546 --> 01:51:21,088
<i>Members of rescue unit CN171-11.</i>

1633
01:51:21,213 --> 01:51:22,546
<i>Attention.</i>

1634
01:51:23,963 --> 01:51:25,255
<i>This is...</i>

1635
01:51:25,338 --> 01:51:26,546
<i>an order.</i>

1636
01:51:30,463 --> 01:51:31,630
<i>Live on.</i>

1637
01:52:52,213 --> 01:52:54,296
Liu Qi! Duoduo!

1638
01:53:33,880 --> 01:53:35,213
The transporter!

1639
01:53:35,296 --> 01:53:37,463
The transporter is falling down!

1640
01:54:19,796 --> 01:54:21,046
We...

1641
01:54:21,921 --> 01:54:23,963
We finally made it.

1642
01:54:28,838 --> 01:54:30,880
<i>Warning. Low temperature.</i>

1643
01:54:31,380 --> 01:54:34,130
<i>Warning. Please check helmet's seal.</i>

1644
01:54:34,588 --> 01:54:36,838
<i>Warning. Low temperature.</i>

1645
01:54:37,130 --> 01:54:39,963
<i>Warning. Please check helmet's seal.</i>

1646
01:54:40,046 --> 01:54:41,630
Liu Qi.

1647
01:54:41,713 --> 01:54:43,130
Help!

1648
01:54:43,213 --> 01:54:44,505
Tim! Get down here!

1649
01:54:44,588 --> 01:54:45,689
Right away, I'm coming!

1650
01:54:45,713 --> 01:54:47,233
- Help us!
- Right away!

1651
01:55:35,463 --> 01:55:36,588
<i>Earth...</i>

1652
01:55:38,130 --> 01:55:39,588
<i>survived.</i>

1653
01:55:47,171 --> 01:55:48,171
<i>The Sun</i>

1654
01:55:48,338 --> 01:55:50,630
<i>is located at the Milky Way's Orion arm.</i>

1655
01:55:50,713 --> 01:55:54,463
<i>Its mass constitutes 99.68 percent
of the Solar System.</i>

1656
01:55:55,755 --> 01:55:58,796
<i>Now, the core of the Sun
is rapidly degenerating</i>

1657
01:55:58,880 --> 01:56:00,022
<i>- and expanding.</i>
- Go to have a look there!

1658
01:56:00,046 --> 01:56:01,505
<i>Earth will be engulfed.</i>

1659
01:56:02,505 --> 01:56:06,505
<i>To survive, mankind began
a groundbreaking project</i>

1660
01:56:06,588 --> 01:56:08,088
<i>to maneuver the entire planet</i>

1661
01:56:08,171 --> 01:56:11,546
<i>to a new home
located 4.2 light years away.</i>

1662
01:56:11,630 --> 01:56:13,421
I miss you all so badly!

1663
01:56:14,671 --> 01:56:15,711
- Hi, guys.
- Sir.

1664
01:56:16,338 --> 01:56:18,838
<i>The project is divided into five phases.</i>

1665
01:56:18,963 --> 01:56:22,463
<i>Phase one. Mankind will construct
10,000 thrusters</i>

1666
01:56:22,546 --> 01:56:23,731
- <i>for Earth's propulsion...</i>
- Hey, that's him.

1667
01:56:23,755 --> 01:56:25,338
<i>...called Earth Engines,</i>

1668
01:56:25,421 --> 01:56:28,546
<i>along with 10,000 underground cities
to protect human lives.</i>

1669
01:56:28,630 --> 01:56:29,838
I... I didn't do it.

1670
01:56:30,505 --> 01:56:31,838
See you!

1671
01:56:33,088 --> 01:56:34,505
<i>Phase two.</i>

1672
01:56:34,588 --> 01:56:37,921
<i>Activating the Torque Engines
encircled along the equator</i>

1673
01:56:38,005 --> 01:56:40,130
<i>to stop Earth's rotation.</i>

1674
01:56:40,213 --> 01:56:41,213
<i>A non-rotating Earth</i>

1675
01:56:41,255 --> 01:56:43,838
<i>will create mega tsunamis
that will sweep through the planet,</i>

1676
01:56:43,921 --> 01:56:46,296
<i>eradicating half of the global population.</i>

1677
01:56:50,338 --> 01:56:51,647
I'm all set and ready to go.

1678
01:56:51,671 --> 01:56:53,005
If there is no accident...

1679
01:56:54,505 --> 01:56:56,689
- <i>Phase three. The Earth...</i>
- ...in three hours...

1680
01:56:56,713 --> 01:56:58,314
<i>will use the gravitational force
of the Sun</i>

1681
01:56:58,338 --> 01:57:00,630
<i>and Jupiter for final acceleration,</i>

1682
01:57:00,713 --> 01:57:02,921
<i>embarking on a voyage of wandering.</i>

1683
01:57:03,005 --> 01:57:04,125
Will your sister come along?

1684
01:57:05,380 --> 01:57:06,380
Screw you.

1685
01:57:07,963 --> 01:57:09,088
After all these years,

1686
01:57:09,963 --> 01:57:11,088
you haven't changed one bit.

1687
01:57:13,213 --> 01:57:14,213
<i>Phase four.</i>

1688
01:57:14,588 --> 01:57:18,421
<i>When the Earth leaves the Solar System,
the Earth Engines will turn on full power,</i>

1689
01:57:18,880 --> 01:57:21,671
<i>spending 500 years to accelerate
to five one thousandths</i>

1690
01:57:21,755 --> 01:57:25,380
<i>of the speed of light,
then gliding for 1,300 years.</i>

1691
01:57:25,463 --> 01:57:28,296
<i>After that,
reversing Earth Engines' directions,</i>

1692
01:57:28,380 --> 01:57:30,880
<i>spending another 700 years
in deceleration.</i>

1693
01:57:35,963 --> 01:57:36,796
Liu Hu Kou.

1694
01:57:36,880 --> 01:57:38,046
Where have you been?

1695
01:57:38,713 --> 01:57:40,130
Why is Li Yiyi here too?

1696
01:57:41,088 --> 01:57:42,088
<i>Phase five.</i>

1697
01:57:42,130 --> 01:57:44,338
<i>Earth begins to join
the targeted sollar system,</i>

1698
01:57:44,421 --> 01:57:45,713
<i>arriving at our new home</i>,

1699
01:57:46,046 --> 01:57:48,630
<i>becoming a new planet
of the targeted sollar system.</i>

1700
01:57:48,713 --> 01:57:52,505
Stop calling me Hu Kou.
Where are your manners?

1701
01:57:54,046 --> 01:57:55,046
Call me brother.

1702
01:57:55,338 --> 01:57:56,755
<i>Liu Qi.</i>

1703
01:57:56,838 --> 01:57:58,338
<i>Junior driver.</i>

1704
01:57:58,421 --> 01:58:01,921
<i>Beijing No. 3 Transportation Division
reminds you.</i>

1705
01:58:02,463 --> 01:58:04,130
<i>Routes are countless.</i>

1706
01:58:04,213 --> 01:58:06,296
<i>Safety is foremost.</i>

1707
01:58:07,213 --> 01:58:09,005
<i>With unregulated driving,</i>

1708
01:58:09,088 --> 01:58:11,296
<i>your loved ones might end up in tears.</i>

1709
01:58:16,963 --> 01:58:19,005
<i>Can you drive? Liu Hu Kou!</i>

1710
01:58:19,088 --> 01:58:22,213
<i>Li Yiyi! You're blocking my view
with that bag!</i>

1711
01:58:22,296 --> 01:58:24,421
<i>Not my fault.</i>

1712
01:58:25,463 --> 01:58:28,380
<i>How am I blocking your vision
when I'm sitting behind you?</i>

1713
01:58:28,838 --> 01:58:31,005
<i>This project will last
for 100 generations.</i>

1714
01:58:31,088 --> 01:58:33,772
- Be careful, someone is there!
- Oh, shit, what's going on?

1715
01:58:33,796 --> 01:58:36,963
<i>We have no idea
what the new Sun at 4.2 light years away</i>

1716
01:58:37,046 --> 01:58:38,380
<i>will bring to our new home.</i>

1717
01:58:38,755 --> 01:58:42,171
<i>But from this day on,
the courage and perseverance of mankind</i>

1718
01:58:42,255 --> 01:58:44,338
<i>will be etched among the stars.</i>

1719
01:58:45,005 --> 01:58:47,213
<i>This long voyage of hope through despair</i>

1720
01:58:47,296 --> 01:58:50,213
<i>will last 2,500 years across the cosmos.</i>

1721
01:58:50,755 --> 01:58:53,671
<i>It is also known as
the Wandering Earth Project.</i>
