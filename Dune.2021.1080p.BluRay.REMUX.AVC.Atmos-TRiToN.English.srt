17

<i>By controlling spice production,</i>

18
00:01:59,537 --> 00:02:01,330
<i>they became obscenely rich.</i>

19
00:02:01,664 --> 00:02:03,457
<i>Richer than the Emperor himself.</i>

<i>by Imperial decree, they were gone.</i>

28

<i>Why did the Emperor choose this path?</i>

29
00:03:04,727 --> 00:03:06,979

It's good you're up early.

Full dress?

37
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:08,749
Military?

38
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:11,377
- Ceremonial.
- [Paul sighs]

39
00:04:12,128 --> 00:04:13,337
Why do we have to go
through all this

40
00:04:13,421 --> 00:04:14,588
when it's already been decided?

41
00:04:16,215 --> 00:04:17,258
Ceremony.

42
00:04:17,967 --> 00:04:18,968
Mm.

43
00:04:19,885 --> 00:04:20,803
Thank you.

44
00:04:22,721 --> 00:04:24,515
If you want it, make me give it to you.

45
00:04:26,016 --> 00:04:26,976
Use the Voice.

46
00:04:27,726 --> 00:04:28,853
Mom, I just woke up.

47
00:04:37,153 --> 00:04:38,279
Give me the water.

Command me.

Almost.

[normal voice] Almost?

54
00:05:26,368 --> 00:05:28,621
Bene Gesserit skills

55
00:05:28,704 --> 00:05:30,915
- [Paul] Mm-hmm.
- You look tired.

56
00:05:32,249 --> 00:05:33,292
More dreams?

57
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:40,424
No.

<i>extremely hazardous.</i>

76
00:06:32,601 --> 00:06:35,729
<i>For the Fremen,

of the Known Universe,

98

I stand before you
as Herald of the Change.

99

We are witnessed by members

"House Atreides shall immediately
take control of Arrakis

104
00:08:49,113 --> 00:08:51,615
and serve as its steward."

105
00:08:53,701 --> 00:08:54,702
Do you accept?

106
00:09:04,962 --> 00:09:06,380
[Leto] We are House Atreides.

107
00:09:07,881 --> 00:09:11,635
There is no call we do not answer,
there is no faith that we betray.

108
00:09:12,428 --> 00:09:16,014
The Emperor asks us
to bring peace to Arrakis.

109
00:09:17,307 --> 00:09:19,143
House Atreides accepts.

110
00:09:20,018 --> 00:09:23,689
[officers chanting]
Atreides! Atreides! Atreides!

111

So, it's done?

114
00:10:16,158 --> 00:10:17,159
It's done.

115
00:10:43,811 --> 00:10:44,812
[Lanville] How was it?

- Hey. Hey.

122
00:10:55,155 --> 00:10:56,281
[Duncan] Paul, my boy.

123
00:10:58,450 --> 00:10:59,868
So, you're going to Arrakis tomorrow.

124
00:11:00,911 --> 00:11:01,995
With the advance team.

125
00:11:02,496 --> 00:11:03,747
Yes, I'm going to Arrakis tomorrow

126
00:11:03,831 --> 00:11:04,873
with the advance team.

127
00:11:06,458 --> 00:11:07,668
I'd like you to take me with you.

128
00:11:08,752 --> 00:11:09,753
You would?

129
00:11:11,129 --> 00:11:12,548
Well, that's too bad. 'Cause no.

130
00:11:14,007 --> 00:11:15,050
[Paul] Duncan.

131
00:11:15,217 --> 00:11:17,010
Are you trying
to get me court-martialed?

132
00:11:18,637 --> 00:11:19,721
What's going on?

133
00:11:19,805 --> 00:11:20,848
Can I trust you with something?

134
00:11:21,348 --> 00:11:22,307
Always. You know that.

135
00:11:24,393 --> 00:11:25,477
[sighs]

136
00:11:29,231 --> 00:11:30,899
I've been having dreams.

137
00:11:33,318 --> 00:11:35,445
About Arrakis and the Fremen.

138
00:11:35,946 --> 00:11:37,948
[ethereal music playing]

139
00:11:44,288 --> 00:11:45,372
[Duncan] Okay.

140
00:11:46,081 --> 00:11:47,207
So?

141
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:49,835
I saw you.

142
00:11:53,338 --> 00:11:54,506
<i>With the Fremen.</i>

143
00:11:55,424 --> 00:11:56,425
Ah.

144
00:11:57,342 --> 00:11:58,510
So, I do find them.

145
00:11:58,719 --> 00:12:00,721
There you go. That's a good
omen right there, right?

146
00:12:03,473 --> 00:12:04,474
Lanville!

147
00:12:11,189 --> 00:12:12,649
I saw you lying dead.

148
00:12:13,567 --> 00:12:15,152
Fallen in battle.

149
00:12:17,154 --> 00:12:18,697
<i>It felt like if I had been there,</i>

150
00:12:19,448 --> 00:12:20,699
<i>you'd be alive.</i>

151
00:12:25,871 --> 00:12:27,581
First off, I'm not gonna die.

152
00:12:27,915 --> 00:12:28,999
You're not taking me seriously.

153
00:12:29,082 --> 00:12:30,876
That's why you want
to come with me. Listen.

154
00:12:32,794 --> 00:12:34,046
Dreams make good stories,

155
00:12:34,588 --> 00:12:36,506
but everything important
happens when we're awake.

156
00:12:37,007 --> 00:12:38,383
'Cause that's when
we make things happen.

157
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:41,094
Look at you. Put on some muscle?

158
00:12:41,386 --> 00:12:42,262
I did?

159
00:12:42,554 --> 00:12:43,639
No.

160
00:12:46,224 --> 00:12:47,392
Hey.

161
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:49,895
See you on Arrakis, my boy.

162
00:12:52,856 --> 00:12:53,857
[sighs]

163
00:12:57,653 --> 00:12:58,820
[animal chirping]

164
00:13:25,597 --> 00:13:27,557
Father, I'd like to ask
to join Duncan Idaho

165
00:13:27,641 --> 00:13:29,851
on his scout mission
to Arrakis tomorrow.

166
00:13:30,477 --> 00:13:32,145
I've studied the Fremen language,
I'd be an asset.

167
00:13:32,312 --> 00:13:33,438
Out of the question.

168
00:13:33,605 --> 00:13:34,982
You'll travel in a few weeks to Arrakis,

169
00:13:35,065 --> 00:13:36,066
like the rest of us.

170
00:13:36,233 --> 00:13:37,567
I've been training my whole life.

171
00:13:37,651 --> 00:13:39,152
What is the point if I'm not allowed

172
00:13:39,236 --> 00:13:41,029
- to face some actual risk?
- You know why, Paul.

173
00:13:41,947 --> 00:13:43,782
You're the future of House Atreides.

174
00:13:44,116 --> 00:13:46,118
And Grandfather fought bulls for sport!

175
00:13:46,201 --> 00:13:47,077
Yes.

176
00:13:48,328 --> 00:13:49,496
And look where that got him.

177
00:13:54,251 --> 00:13:55,627
I need you by my side.

178
00:13:56,878 --> 00:13:59,214
When we get to Arrakis,
we'll face enormous danger.

179
00:13:59,631 --> 00:14:00,716
What danger?

180
00:14:01,425 --> 00:14:03,260
The Fremen? The desert?

181
00:14:03,343 --> 00:14:04,803
Political danger.

182
00:14:07,431 --> 00:14:09,891
The Great Houses
look to us for leadership,

183
00:14:10,517 --> 00:14:12,185
and this threatens the Emperor.

184
00:14:12,811 --> 00:14:15,731
By taking Arrakis from the Harkonnens
and making it ours,

185
00:14:16,106 --> 00:14:17,607
he sets the stage for a war

186
00:14:18,233 --> 00:14:19,901
which would weaken both houses.

187
00:14:21,862 --> 00:14:23,238
But if we hold firm,

188
00:14:23,822 --> 00:14:25,741
and tap the true power of Arrakis,

189
00:14:25,824 --> 00:14:27,617
we could be stronger than ever.

190
00:14:28,118 --> 00:14:29,202
What does that mean?

191
00:14:30,037 --> 00:14:32,497
Mining spice,
keeping the Fremen in their place?

192
00:14:32,664 --> 00:14:34,332
- We'd be no better than Harkonnens.
- No.

193
00:14:35,667 --> 00:14:38,045
By making an alliance with the Fremen.

194
00:14:38,962 --> 00:14:41,089
That's what I've sent
Duncan Idaho to arrange.

195
00:14:42,758 --> 00:14:43,675
Here on Caladan,

196
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:46,553
we've ruled by air power and sea power.

197
00:14:46,803 --> 00:14:50,140
On Arrakis, we need
to cultivate desert power.

198
00:14:53,935 --> 00:14:55,353
I want you sitting in on my Council.

199
00:14:55,645 --> 00:14:56,730
Learn what I do.

200
00:14:57,189 --> 00:14:58,398
What if I'm not, Dad?

201
00:14:59,858 --> 00:15:00,734
Not what?

202
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:05,155
The future of House Atreides.

203
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:09,493
[Leto sighs]

204
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:20,128
I told my father
I didn't want this either.

205
00:15:24,633 --> 00:15:25,801
I wanted to be a pilot.

206
00:15:27,803 --> 00:15:28,970
You never told me that.

207
00:15:32,307 --> 00:15:33,517
Your grandfather said,

208
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:36,561
"A great man doesn't seek to lead.

209
00:15:37,354 --> 00:15:40,398
He's called to it, and he answers."

210
00:15:42,651 --> 00:15:44,194
And if your answer is no...

211
00:15:47,781 --> 00:15:50,075
you'll still be the only thing
I ever needed you to be...

212
00:15:52,577 --> 00:15:53,620
my son.

213
00:16:04,131 --> 00:16:07,676
I found my own way to it.
Maybe you'll find yours.

214
00:16:11,471 --> 00:16:12,722
In their memory...

215
00:16:15,892 --> 00:16:16,977
give it a try.

216
00:16:24,401 --> 00:16:25,735
[grunting]

217
00:16:26,444 --> 00:16:28,446
[Gurney] Don't stand
with your back to the door.

218
00:16:29,948 --> 00:16:31,491
How many times do we have to tell you?

219
00:16:31,575 --> 00:16:32,993
[Paul grunts] I could tell it was you

220
00:16:33,076 --> 00:16:34,744
by your footsteps, Gurney Halleck.

221
00:16:34,911 --> 00:16:36,997
[Gurney] Someone
might imitate my stride.

222
00:16:37,706 --> 00:16:38,999
[Paul] I know the difference.

223
00:16:39,166 --> 00:16:40,667
Are you the new Weapons Master?

224
00:16:40,834 --> 00:16:44,337
With Duncan Idaho gone,
I must make do as best I can.

225
00:16:45,547 --> 00:16:46,548
Choose your blade.

226
00:16:47,007 --> 00:16:48,300
I've had quite a day, Gurney.

227
00:16:48,967 --> 00:16:50,135
Give us a song instead.

228
00:16:55,432 --> 00:16:56,474
[smacks lips] That's rude.

229
00:16:57,851 --> 00:16:59,019
[Paul grunts]

230
00:17:01,396 --> 00:17:02,314
[powers up]

231
00:17:06,610 --> 00:17:07,527
[device beeps]

232
00:17:11,323 --> 00:17:12,282
[Paul groans]

233
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:13,491
[panting]

234
00:17:14,034 --> 00:17:14,993
[Gurney] Come on.

235
00:17:15,619 --> 00:17:16,620
Come on.

236
00:17:16,703 --> 00:17:17,704
Old man.

237
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,080
[exhales forcefully]

238
00:17:25,295 --> 00:17:26,296
[Paul grunts]

239
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:29,299
[device beeps]

240
00:17:29,758 --> 00:17:31,968
Ah, the slow blade
penetrates the shield.

241
00:17:36,973 --> 00:17:37,933
[groans]

242
00:17:39,392 --> 00:17:40,518
I guess I'm not in the mood today.

243
00:17:41,228 --> 00:17:42,354
- Mood?
- Yeah.

244
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:43,521
What's mood to do with it?

245
00:17:43,688 --> 00:17:45,440
You fight when the necessity arises,

246
00:17:45,523 --> 00:17:46,524
no matter the mood.

247
00:17:46,608 --> 00:17:47,651
Now fight!

248
00:17:49,361 --> 00:17:50,946
[both grunting]

249
00:17:53,156 --> 00:17:54,157
Come on!

250
00:18:05,961 --> 00:18:07,837
- [device beeps]
- I have you.

251
00:18:08,296 --> 00:18:09,422
Aye.

252
00:18:10,173 --> 00:18:11,758
But look down, my lord.

253
00:18:11,925 --> 00:18:13,593
You'd have joined me in death.

254
00:18:14,594 --> 00:18:16,388
I see you found the mood.

255
00:18:17,681 --> 00:18:18,974
[Gurney panting]

256
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:26,398
[devices deactivate]

257
00:18:28,858 --> 00:18:29,943
Will it be that bad?

258
00:18:30,485 --> 00:18:31,653
You don't get it, do you?

259
00:18:33,113 --> 00:18:34,239
You don't really understand

260
00:18:34,322 --> 00:18:36,700
the grave nature
of what's happening to us.

261
00:18:39,536 --> 00:18:40,912
For 80 years,

262
00:18:40,996 --> 00:18:43,081
Arrakis belonged to House Harkonnen.

263
00:18:43,248 --> 00:18:45,583
80 years of owning the spice fields.

264
00:18:45,917 --> 00:18:47,502
Can you imagine the wealth?

265
00:18:48,044 --> 00:18:49,879
Your eyes.
I need to see it in your eyes.

266
00:18:50,046 --> 00:18:52,340
You never met Harkonnens
before, I have.

267
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,676
They're not human, they're brutal!

268
00:18:55,677 --> 00:18:57,220
You have to be ready.

269
00:19:07,939 --> 00:19:09,733
[dramatic ominous music playing]

270
00:19:39,554 --> 00:19:40,597
[Rabban] Lord Baron.

271
00:19:42,932 --> 00:19:44,017
[Vladimir] Rabban.

272
00:19:45,226 --> 00:19:47,187
The last of our ships have left Arrakis.

273
00:19:48,688 --> 00:19:49,689
It's done.

274
00:19:50,357 --> 00:19:51,441
[Vladimir] Very good.

275
00:19:54,986 --> 00:19:56,321
Uncle, how can we let this happen?

276
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:57,947
How can the Emperor...

277
00:19:59,366 --> 00:20:01,409
[shouting] ...take everything
we've built

278
00:20:01,993 --> 00:20:03,411
and give it to that Duke?

279
00:20:04,079 --> 00:20:05,080
How?

280
00:20:05,705 --> 00:20:07,582
Don't be too sure it's an act of love.

281
00:20:08,291 --> 00:20:09,542
[breathes heavily]

282
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:11,378
What does he mean?

283
00:20:17,967 --> 00:20:20,220
When is a gift not a gift?

284
00:20:22,597 --> 00:20:25,100
The Atreides' voice is rising,

285
00:20:26,434 --> 00:20:28,770
and the Emperor is a jealous man.

286
00:20:31,815 --> 00:20:34,609
A dangerous, jealous man.

287
00:20:35,902 --> 00:20:37,278
[ominous music playing]

288
00:20:49,332 --> 00:20:51,126
[voices chanting indistinctly]

289
00:21:02,595 --> 00:21:04,097
[voices continue chanting]

290
00:21:32,959 --> 00:21:33,835
[voices fade]

291
00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:46,806
Paul.

292
00:21:48,725 --> 00:21:49,851
[softly] Paul, wake up.

293
00:21:56,441 --> 00:21:57,442
What's wrong?

294
00:21:57,525 --> 00:21:58,860
Get dressed and come with me.

295
00:22:20,173 --> 00:22:21,341
What is this?

296
00:22:21,508 --> 00:22:23,885
The Reverend Mother
Gaius Helen Mohiam is here.

297
00:22:24,802 --> 00:22:26,846
She was my teacher
at the Bene Gesserit school.

298
00:22:27,013 --> 00:22:29,390
She's now Truthsayer
to the Emperor himself.

299
00:22:30,517 --> 00:22:31,976
She would like to meet you.

300
00:22:32,894 --> 00:22:33,978
Why?

301
00:22:34,938 --> 00:22:36,564
She wants to know about your dreams.

302
00:22:38,441 --> 00:22:40,109
How does she know about my dreams?

303
00:22:42,904 --> 00:22:44,364
And why is Dr. Yueh here?

304
00:22:44,531 --> 00:22:45,907
He only needs a moment.

305
00:22:47,033 --> 00:22:48,284
[Dr. Yueh] Hello, young master.

306
00:22:49,202 --> 00:22:51,162
Your mother asked me
to check your vitals.

307
00:22:57,710 --> 00:22:58,753
What's happening?

308
00:23:02,006 --> 00:23:02,966
[whispering in Mandarin]

309
00:23:20,692 --> 00:23:22,735
[in English] His heart
is strong as ever, my lady.

310
00:23:24,237 --> 00:23:25,238
[in sign language]

311
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:38,626
Paul...

312
00:23:42,088 --> 00:23:43,089
[in sign language]

313
00:24:06,404 --> 00:24:11,784
[eerie voices] <i>Who are you?</i>

314
00:24:16,247 --> 00:24:17,915
Defiance in the eyes.

315
00:24:18,708 --> 00:24:19,834
Like his father.

316
00:24:20,251 --> 00:24:21,252
Leave us.

317
00:24:22,211 --> 00:24:24,255
[whispers] You must do everything
the Reverend Mother tells you.

318
00:24:28,176 --> 00:24:29,510
You dismiss my mother
in her own house.

319
00:24:29,594 --> 00:24:30,678
[Mohiam in distorted voice] Come here.

320
00:24:31,262 --> 00:24:32,263
Kneel.

321
00:24:36,726 --> 00:24:38,311
How dare you use the Voice on me?

322
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:47,028
[normal voice] Put your right
hand in the box.

323
00:24:49,322 --> 00:24:51,157
Your mother bade you obey me.

324
00:24:52,033 --> 00:24:53,076
[Paul breathes heavily]

325
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:02,085
I hold at your neck the Gom Jabbar.

326
00:25:03,586 --> 00:25:04,629
A poison needle.

327
00:25:05,088 --> 00:25:06,130
Instant death.

328
00:25:07,548 --> 00:25:08,591
The test is simple.

329
00:25:09,133 --> 00:25:10,677
Remove your hand from the box

330
00:25:11,552 --> 00:25:12,553
and you die.

331
00:25:14,347 --> 00:25:15,473
What's in the box?

332
00:25:17,225 --> 00:25:18,101
Pain.

333
00:25:19,852 --> 00:25:21,938
- [scoffs]
- No need to call the guards.

334
00:25:23,272 --> 00:25:24,691
Your mother stands behind that door.

335
00:25:24,774 --> 00:25:26,359
No one would get past her.

336
00:25:33,658 --> 00:25:34,867
[Paul] Why are you doing this?

337
00:25:36,703 --> 00:25:40,832
An animal caught in a trap
will gnaw off its own leg to escape.

338
00:25:41,582 --> 00:25:42,834
What will you do?

339
00:25:48,715 --> 00:25:50,341
[high-pitched whirring]

340
00:25:55,346 --> 00:25:56,514
[groans]

341
00:26:00,435 --> 00:26:01,561
[exhales sharply]

342
00:26:05,606 --> 00:26:06,899
[sobbing softly]

343
00:26:08,484 --> 00:26:09,777
[shudders]

344
00:26:14,824 --> 00:26:16,325
- [grunts in pain]
- Silence.

345
00:26:17,034 --> 00:26:18,661
[Paul breathing raggedly]

346
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,668
- [Paul grunts in pain]
- [shuddering]

347
00:26:26,127 --> 00:26:27,545
I must not fear.

348
00:26:29,547 --> 00:26:30,882
I must not fear.

349
00:26:32,258 --> 00:26:34,385
[stifles grunt, whimpers]

350
00:26:34,719 --> 00:26:36,721
[suppressed groan]

351
00:26:37,638 --> 00:26:39,015
Fear is the mind-killer.

352
00:26:41,267 --> 00:26:42,351
Fear

353
00:26:42,643 --> 00:26:44,896
is the little death
that brings obliteration.

354
00:26:45,229 --> 00:26:46,856
- [whirring intensifies]
- [Paul grunts]

355
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:49,650
And I'll face my fear and I'll permit it

356
00:26:49,734 --> 00:26:50,943
to pass over me and through me.

357
00:26:58,034 --> 00:26:59,744
[ominous music playing]

358
00:27:01,287 --> 00:27:03,247
[dramatic lamentation music playing]

359
00:27:04,165 --> 00:27:05,625
[searing]

360
00:27:06,292 --> 00:27:07,668
And when it has gone past...

361
00:27:16,552 --> 00:27:19,013
I will turn the inner eye
and see its path. [gasps]

362
00:27:22,183 --> 00:27:24,769
[sobs] And where the fear has gone,

363
00:27:25,895 --> 00:27:26,896
there will be nothing.

364
00:27:31,818 --> 00:27:33,152
Only I will remain.

365
00:27:37,657 --> 00:27:38,616
Enough.

366
00:27:38,908 --> 00:27:40,701
- [panting]
- [whirring fading]

367
00:27:55,675 --> 00:27:57,468
Like sifting sand through a screen,

368
00:27:58,302 --> 00:27:59,554
we sift people.

369
00:28:01,138 --> 00:28:03,599
If you had been unable
to control your impulses,

370
00:28:03,683 --> 00:28:04,851
like an animal,

371
00:28:05,726 --> 00:28:06,811
we could not let you live.

372
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:09,438
You inherit too much power.

373
00:28:10,815 --> 00:28:11,816
What, because I'm a duke's son?

374
00:28:11,899 --> 00:28:13,484
Because you are Jessica's son.

375
00:28:15,069 --> 00:28:17,071
You have more than one birthright, boy.

376
00:28:19,031 --> 00:28:20,032
Jessica?

377
00:28:27,373 --> 00:28:28,916
You've been training him in the Way.

378
00:28:33,838 --> 00:28:35,464
Tell me about these dreams.

379
00:28:36,757 --> 00:28:38,759
- I had one tonight.
- What did you see?

380
00:28:41,345 --> 00:28:42,346
A girl.

381
00:28:43,139 --> 00:28:44,140
On Arrakis.

382
00:28:44,932 --> 00:28:46,267
Have you dreamt of her before?

383
00:28:50,605 --> 00:28:51,731
Many times.

384
00:28:54,483 --> 00:28:56,444
Do you often dream things that happen

385
00:28:56,527 --> 00:28:57,737
just as you dreamed them?

386
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:02,325
Not exactly.

387
00:29:06,037 --> 00:29:07,288
Goodbye, young human.

388
00:29:08,414 --> 00:29:09,582
I hope you live.

389
00:29:18,257 --> 00:29:20,009
[Lady Jessica]
Did you have to go that far?

390
00:29:20,384 --> 00:29:21,677
[Mohiam] You chose
to train him in the Way,

391
00:29:22,136 --> 00:29:23,471
in defiance of our rule.

392
00:29:24,055 --> 00:29:25,473
He wields our power.

393
00:29:25,723 --> 00:29:27,350
He had to be tested to the limits.

394
00:29:28,684 --> 00:29:30,728
So much potential, wasted in a male.

395
00:29:32,021 --> 00:29:33,648
You were told to bear only daughters.

396
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:34,982
But you, in your pride,

397
00:29:35,066 --> 00:29:37,068
thought you could
produce the <i>Kwisatz Haderach.</i>

398
00:29:37,443 --> 00:29:38,569
Was I wrong?

399
00:29:39,028 --> 00:29:40,780
You're lucky he didn't die in that room.

400
00:29:41,906 --> 00:29:43,950
If he is The One,
he has a long way to go.

401
00:29:44,241 --> 00:29:46,911
His Sight is barely awakened,
and now he goes into the fire.

402
00:29:48,496 --> 00:29:50,706
But our plans are measured in centuries.

403
00:29:50,873 --> 00:29:52,166
We have other prospects

404
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:54,460
if he fails his promise.

405
00:29:57,588 --> 00:29:59,006
Do you see so little hope?

406
00:30:00,132 --> 00:30:02,760
[Mohiam] On Arrakis, we have done
all we can for you.

407
00:30:03,344 --> 00:30:04,679
A path has been laid.

408
00:30:05,346 --> 00:30:07,098
Let's hope he doesn't squander it.

409
00:30:14,438 --> 00:30:16,107
[voices murmuring indistinctly]

410
00:30:49,098 --> 00:30:50,391
[breathes heavily]

411
00:30:54,645 --> 00:30:55,604
[Lady Jessica] Paul.

412
00:30:57,148 --> 00:30:58,357
[Paul] What does it mean?

413
00:31:00,026 --> 00:31:01,277
That I could be The One?

414
00:31:01,652 --> 00:31:02,820
[Lady Jessica] You heard.

415
00:31:06,365 --> 00:31:07,616
The Bene Gesserit serve

416
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:09,702
as powerful partners
to the Great Houses,

417
00:31:11,162 --> 00:31:12,288
but there's more to it.

418
00:31:12,747 --> 00:31:14,999
You steer the politics of the Imperium

419
00:31:15,082 --> 00:31:16,459
from the shadows.

420
00:31:17,251 --> 00:31:18,252
I know.

421
00:31:18,335 --> 00:31:20,004
You don't know everything.

422
00:31:21,505 --> 00:31:23,215
For thousands of years,

423
00:31:23,382 --> 00:31:25,551
we've been carefully crossing bloodlines

424
00:31:26,135 --> 00:31:27,845
- to bring forth...
- The One?

425
00:31:29,430 --> 00:31:30,639
A mind...

426
00:31:32,808 --> 00:31:36,729
powerful enough
to bridge space and time.

427
00:31:37,730 --> 00:31:39,231
Past and future.

428
00:31:41,734 --> 00:31:43,944
Who can help us into a better future.

429
00:31:45,196 --> 00:31:47,364
We think he's very close now.

430
00:31:49,784 --> 00:31:51,494
Some believe he's here.

431
00:31:55,956 --> 00:31:57,625
All part of a plan.

432
00:32:14,975 --> 00:32:16,560
[slow dramatic music playing]

433
00:32:52,096 --> 00:32:53,597
[slow dramatic music continues]

434
00:34:12,635 --> 00:34:14,094
[spaceship lands]

435
00:34:15,930 --> 00:34:16,889
Shield.

436
00:34:27,942 --> 00:34:29,443
[metallic groan]

437
00:34:32,363 --> 00:34:33,614
[metallic thudding]

438
00:34:34,698 --> 00:34:35,783
[door opens]

439
00:34:59,682 --> 00:35:01,517
"My lungs taste the air of Time,

440
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,185
Blown past falling sand..."

441
00:35:03,644 --> 00:35:04,853
[bagpipe playing]

442
00:35:15,364 --> 00:35:17,366
[band playing patriotic music]

443
00:35:48,230 --> 00:35:49,189
Thufir Hawat.

444
00:35:53,861 --> 00:35:55,362
Young master!

445
00:35:55,529 --> 00:35:57,656
How does it feel
to walk on a new world?

446
00:35:57,823 --> 00:35:59,658
Exciting, to say the least.

447
00:36:00,367 --> 00:36:01,535
My lord.

448
00:36:02,369 --> 00:36:03,370
How are you, old friend?

449
00:36:04,288 --> 00:36:06,415
My advance team has secured the city.

450
00:36:06,749 --> 00:36:08,792
We're still smoothing out
a few rough spots.

451
00:36:11,045 --> 00:36:12,129
My lady.

452
00:36:16,925 --> 00:36:18,385
[woman] <i>Lisan al-Gaib!</i>

453
00:36:30,981 --> 00:36:32,566
[crowd clamoring]

454
00:36:34,735 --> 00:36:37,446
[man] <i>Lisan al-Gaib! Lisan al-Gaib!</i>

455
00:36:38,739 --> 00:36:39,823
[woman 2] <i>Lisan al-Gaib!</i>

00:36:39,948 --> 00:36:42,659
[crowd chanting]
<i>Lisan al-Gaib! Lisan al-Gaib!</i>

459
00:36:49,375 --> 00:36:51,960
<i>Lisan al-Gaib! Lisan al-Gaib!</i>

460
00:36:53,962 --> 00:36:55,672
Don't be fooled by the welcome.

461
00:36:55,964 --> 00:36:57,633
They follow their old masters' rules.

462
00:36:57,716 --> 00:36:58,717
Mandatory attendance.

463
00:36:58,884 --> 00:37:00,677
That's Harkonnen love out there.

464
00:37:02,221 --> 00:37:03,514
[crowd continues chanting]

465
00:37:07,684 --> 00:37:08,685
Atreides!

466
00:37:08,852 --> 00:37:12,648
[soldiers chanting]
Atreides! Atreides! Atreides!

467
00:37:12,981 --> 00:37:16,693
Atreides! Atreides! Atreides!

468
00:37:17,069 --> 00:37:19,071
Atreides! Atreides!

469
00:37:21,698 --> 00:37:23,200
[Thufir] Let's get you out of the sun.

470
00:37:24,284 --> 00:37:26,161
The heat can kill in this place.

471
00:37:35,963 --> 00:37:37,798
[ornithopters powering up]

472
00:37:43,137 --> 00:37:44,304
They were pointing at us.

473
00:37:45,722 --> 00:37:46,723
What are they shouting?

474
00:37:47,141 --> 00:37:50,853
<i>Lisan al-Gaib.</i>
"Voice from the Outer World."

475
00:37:51,145 --> 00:37:52,563
It's their name for "messiah."

476
00:37:54,148 --> 00:37:56,483
It means the Bene Gesserit
have been at work here.

477
00:37:57,484 --> 00:37:59,153
Planting superstitions.

478
00:37:59,862 --> 00:38:01,822
Preparing the way, Paul.

479
00:38:02,823 --> 00:38:05,075
These people
have waited for centuries

480
00:38:05,159 --> 00:38:06,452
for the <i>Lisan al-Gaib.</i>

481
00:38:07,578 --> 00:38:08,620
They see you,

482
00:38:09,538 --> 00:38:10,956
they see the signs.

483
00:38:14,209 --> 00:38:16,044
They see what they've been
told to see.

484
00:38:21,550 --> 00:38:22,551
We're good to go.

485
00:39:06,178 --> 00:39:07,179
[Thufir] Shield Wall.

486
00:39:07,471 --> 00:39:10,516
Protects the city from the weather
and the worms.

487
00:39:19,650 --> 00:39:21,610
[eerie dramatic music playing]

488
00:39:57,854 --> 00:40:00,399
[Gurney] The locals call
the big one the Hand of God.

489
00:40:02,568 --> 00:40:04,945
[Leto] Well, the Hand of God
is wreaking havoc

490
00:40:05,028 --> 00:40:06,238
on our comms system.

491
00:40:09,950 --> 00:40:11,076
It's so quiet.

492
00:40:12,411 --> 00:40:13,412
[Gurney] Yeah.

493
00:40:14,454 --> 00:40:15,872
That's what worries me, too.

494
00:40:23,088 --> 00:40:24,298
[Leto] There's the spaceport

495
00:40:25,048 --> 00:40:27,509
and that plume of dust there
is the spice refinery.

496
00:40:27,884 --> 00:40:29,386
Our two most vulnerable points.

497
00:40:29,761 --> 00:40:31,013
I want you guarding them.

498
00:40:31,346 --> 00:40:33,765
If we can't refine spice
and ship it off-world,

499
00:40:33,932 --> 00:40:35,309
- we're dead here.
- [Lanville] My lord.

500
00:40:36,435 --> 00:40:38,687
The sun's getting too high.
We need to seal the doors.

501
00:40:41,565 --> 00:40:42,566
[Leto sighs]

502
00:40:42,816 --> 00:40:44,693
What do they say
about this hellhole again?

503
00:40:46,069 --> 00:40:48,155
"To shower, you scrub your ass
with sand," my lord.

504
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:49,573
That's what they say.

505
00:40:49,865 --> 00:40:51,074
That's what they say.

506
00:40:56,204 --> 00:40:57,914
[Thufir] Candidates
for a housekeeper, my lady.

507
00:41:14,765 --> 00:41:15,724
What is your name?

508
00:41:16,350 --> 00:41:17,726
Shadout Mapes, my lady.

509
00:41:20,228 --> 00:41:21,605
[Lady Jessica] The rest of you may go.

510
00:41:22,064 --> 00:41:23,106
Thank you.

511
00:41:25,651 --> 00:41:26,610
Shadout.

512
00:41:27,736 --> 00:41:29,071
It's an old Chakobsa word.

513
00:41:30,197 --> 00:41:31,281
"Well-dipper."

514
00:41:32,032 --> 00:41:33,033
[speaking Chakobsa]

515
00:41:34,284 --> 00:41:35,619
[in English]
You know the ancient tongues?

516
00:41:35,786 --> 00:41:36,912
I know many things.

517
00:41:37,496 --> 00:41:40,248
I know that you have a weapon
concealed in your bodice.

518
00:41:40,415 --> 00:41:41,500
[in sign language]

519
00:41:42,542 --> 00:41:43,710
[speaking] If you mean to harm me,

520
00:41:44,795 --> 00:41:46,755
I must warn you,
whatever you're hiding,

521
00:41:47,839 --> 00:41:49,132
it won't be enough.

522
00:41:51,385 --> 00:41:53,303
The weapon is meant as a gift

523
00:41:54,763 --> 00:41:56,431
if you are truly The One.

524
00:42:12,572 --> 00:42:13,907
Do you know this?

525
00:42:15,742 --> 00:42:17,119
It's a crysknife.

526
00:42:20,997 --> 00:42:22,165
Do you know its meaning?

527
00:42:22,249 --> 00:42:23,250
[in sign language]

528
00:42:26,586 --> 00:42:27,838
It's a maker...

00:42:33,510 --> 00:42:35,429
A maker of the deep desert.

531
00:42:38,682 --> 00:42:40,726
When you have lived
with prophecy for so long,

532
00:42:40,892 --> 00:42:42,978
the moment of revelation
is a shock.

533
00:42:43,812 --> 00:42:44,980

534
00:42:45,439 --> 00:42:46,648

535
00:42:53,488 --> 00:42:54,698
It is yours.

[Paul] Hello.

541
00:43:51,546 --> 00:43:53,507
You shouldn't be out here
at this hour of the day.

542
00:43:56,134 --> 00:43:57,219
They're out here.

543
00:43:58,428 --> 00:44:00,472
[gardener] Hmm. Fremen pilgrims.

544
00:44:01,473 --> 00:44:03,141
They don't care about heatstroke.

545
00:44:05,227 --> 00:44:07,270
I didn't know date palms
could even be found out here.

546
00:44:08,355 --> 00:44:10,857
[gardener] Oh, these aren't indigenous.

547
00:44:11,650 --> 00:44:13,193
They can't survive without me.

548
00:44:14,110 --> 00:44:15,111
Each one of these

549
00:44:15,195 --> 00:44:17,531
drinks every day
the equivalent of five men.

550
00:44:20,158 --> 00:44:21,535
Twenty palm trees.

551
00:44:22,994 --> 00:44:24,120
A hundred lives.

552
00:44:25,747 --> 00:44:27,874
Should we remove them?
Save the water?

553
00:44:27,958 --> 00:44:29,000
No, no, no.

554
00:44:29,251 --> 00:44:30,460
These are sacred.

555
00:44:35,257 --> 00:44:36,508
Old dream.

556
00:44:44,850 --> 00:44:46,852
[narrator over speakers]
<i>The largest and most dangerous</i>

557
00:44:46,935 --> 00:44:49,813
<i>organism on Arrakis is the sandworm,</i>

558
00:44:50,230 --> 00:44:53,650
<i>capable of reaching
400 meters in length.</i>

559
00:44:54,276 --> 00:44:57,445
<i>To avoid making rhythmic noises,

560
00:44:58,238 --> 00:45:02,325
<i>the Fremen cross desert spaces

00:45:02,450 --> 00:45:05,120
<i>a dance-like motion

562
00:45:05,245 --> 00:45:08,123
<i>which emulates the natural

563
00:45:09,499 --> 00:45:12,043
<i>What scant plant life

564
00:45:12,210 --> 00:45:13,795
<i>is thanks to the Fremen,</i>

565
00:45:13,879 --> 00:45:16,798

<i>These plants cling to life</i>

572
00:45:34,232 --> 00:45:36,902
<i>in a parched, nutrient-poor landscape.</i>

[slow suspenseful music playing]

574
00:46:33,500 --> 00:46:35,752
[music building up]

575
00:46:42,050 --> 00:46:43,343
[both gasp]

576
00:46:47,597 --> 00:46:48,974
[Paul] It's a hunter-seeker.

577
00:46:49,432 --> 00:46:50,934
The operator must be nearby.

578
00:46:51,518 --> 00:46:53,061
[dramatic music playing]

579
00:46:56,606 --> 00:46:57,983
[Thufir] <i>The Harkonnen agent

580
00:46:58,066 --> 00:46:59,401
<i>into that hole six weeks ago.</i>

<i>Ran the hunter-seeker

<i>inside the walls.</i>

583
00:47:04,239 --> 00:47:06,366
Sire, I failed you today.
There's no excuse.

584
00:47:07,283 --> 00:47:08,284
You have my resignation.

585
00:47:08,451 --> 00:47:09,995
You would deprive us
of your talents at this time?

586
00:47:10,370 --> 00:47:11,454
Sire, my honor demands...

587
00:47:11,538 --> 00:47:13,123
They tried to take the life of my son!

588
00:47:14,416 --> 00:47:15,875
I don't give a damn about your honor.

589
00:47:16,042 --> 00:47:18,253
You want absolution?
Go catch some spies.

590
00:47:18,712 --> 00:47:19,713
Your Grace.

591
00:47:27,262 --> 00:47:28,638
[Mohiam] The thing must leave.

592
00:47:29,514 --> 00:47:31,057
[man] You can speak without fear.

593
00:47:32,100 --> 00:47:34,269
Our pet doesn't understand
your language.

594
00:47:34,436 --> 00:47:35,770
[Mohiam in distorted voice] Get out.

595
00:47:40,316 --> 00:47:41,401
[normal voice] It understands.

596
00:47:42,068 --> 00:47:43,236
Activate silence.

597
00:47:47,240 --> 00:47:48,241
[low, muffled speech]

598
00:47:59,002 --> 00:48:00,295
[Mohiam] It must never be known.

599
00:48:01,463 --> 00:48:03,923
[Vladimir] There's no satellites
over Arrakis.

600
00:48:04,424 --> 00:48:06,634
The Atreides will die in the dark.

601
00:48:08,053 --> 00:48:09,387
[Mohiam] On that matter,

602
00:48:09,929 --> 00:48:13,099
Duke Leto Atreides
means nothing to our order.

603
00:48:13,475 --> 00:48:14,934
But his wife is under our protection

604
00:48:15,101 --> 00:48:17,020
and by extension, her son.

605
00:48:17,979 --> 00:48:20,065
Allow them the dignity of exile.

606
00:48:22,233 --> 00:48:23,485
[sighs]

607
00:48:24,611 --> 00:48:26,529
House Harkonnen would never dream

608
00:48:26,613 --> 00:48:28,990
of violating the sanctity of your order.

609
00:48:30,533 --> 00:48:31,868
I give you my word.

610
00:48:32,243 --> 00:48:33,536
We will not harm them.

611
00:48:54,224 --> 00:48:55,600
If the Duke's son lives...

612
00:48:55,892 --> 00:48:57,936
No Atreides will live.

613
00:48:58,478 --> 00:49:00,438
My lord, you gave your word
to the witch.

614
00:49:00,814 --> 00:49:01,898
She sees too much.

615
00:49:02,065 --> 00:49:03,650
I said I would not harm them.

616
00:49:03,983 --> 00:49:05,026
And I shall not.

617
00:49:05,401 --> 00:49:07,153
But Arrakis is Arrakis.

618
00:49:08,738 --> 00:49:10,740
And the desert takes the weak.

619
00:49:13,451 --> 00:49:14,619
My desert.

620
00:49:15,537 --> 00:49:17,205
[sinister music playing]

621
00:49:17,413 --> 00:49:18,873
My Arrakis.

622
00:49:21,459 --> 00:49:22,544
My Dune.

623
00:49:26,297 --> 00:49:27,966
[Gurney] Your first strategy meeting.

624
00:49:28,591 --> 00:49:29,592
Paul Atreides,

625
00:49:29,676 --> 00:49:31,845
who catches hunter-seekers
in his bare hands

626
00:49:31,928 --> 00:49:33,138
like a hero of old.

627
00:49:33,263 --> 00:49:34,764
[laughter]

628
00:49:35,598 --> 00:49:37,350
[whispers] Thanks
for the humiliation, old man.

629
00:49:37,976 --> 00:49:38,935
Gotta keep an eye on you.

630
00:49:39,978 --> 00:49:41,104
Attention!

631
00:49:49,279 --> 00:49:50,446
Let's get started.

632
00:49:53,158 --> 00:49:54,659
Thufir. Operations.

633
00:49:55,326 --> 00:49:57,620
I secured a copy
of the Harkonnens' account books.

634
00:49:58,371 --> 00:49:59,539
[men murmuring]

635
00:50:00,206 --> 00:50:01,166
The Harkonnens were taking

636
00:50:01,249 --> 00:50:04,043
10 billion solaris
out of here every year.

637
00:50:05,253 --> 00:50:07,589
"They shall suck
of the abundance of the seas,

638
00:50:07,922 --> 00:50:09,257
and the treasure hid in the sand."

639
00:50:09,549 --> 00:50:11,759
[Thufir] We won't see profits
like that for a while.

640
00:50:12,135 --> 00:50:13,845
Not with the equipment they left us.

641
00:50:14,971 --> 00:50:16,055
How bad is it?

642
00:50:22,478 --> 00:50:24,147
[Thufir] These are spice silos.

643
00:50:25,857 --> 00:50:27,942
We're meant to fill every crate.

644
00:50:29,152 --> 00:50:30,069
[Paul] All of them?

645
00:50:30,945 --> 00:50:32,906
Every 25 standard days.

646
00:50:33,948 --> 00:50:35,992
Harkonnen sabotage slows us down.

647
00:50:36,367 --> 00:50:37,827
[Paul] But who's meant to arbitrate?

648
00:50:37,994 --> 00:50:39,120
Isn't there a Judge of the Change

649
00:50:39,204 --> 00:50:40,413
to oversee the transition?

650
00:50:40,788 --> 00:50:41,789
Who did the Emperor appoint?

651
00:50:42,165 --> 00:50:44,751
Dr. Liet Kynes. Imperial Ecologist.

652
00:50:45,210 --> 00:50:46,294
Been here 20 years.

653
00:50:46,878 --> 00:50:48,338
Eccentric, from what I'm told.

654
00:50:48,755 --> 00:50:50,757
I want to see these
harvesting fields myself.

655
00:50:51,841 --> 00:50:52,884
I wouldn't recommend it, my lord.

656
00:50:53,384 --> 00:50:55,428
Have this Judge of the Change
accompany us.

657
00:50:55,845 --> 00:50:57,096
A meeting's long overdue.

658
00:50:57,513 --> 00:50:59,390
And we'll get a bit
of Imperial protection.

659
00:50:59,641 --> 00:51:01,059
A hostage. [chuckles]

660
00:51:01,184 --> 00:51:02,185
I love it.

661
00:51:02,435 --> 00:51:03,311
Hmm.

662
00:51:03,394 --> 00:51:05,563
- [engine roaring]
- He's here, my lord.

663
00:51:28,127 --> 00:51:29,629
[Duncan well-wishing in Chakobsa]

664
00:51:30,088 --> 00:51:31,589
[in English] Take care of them.
They are friends.

665
00:51:31,923 --> 00:51:32,924
[Paul] Duncan!

666
00:51:33,216 --> 00:51:34,384
[Duncan] Ah! My boy!

667
00:51:34,759 --> 00:51:35,969
[both laughing]

668
00:51:40,014 --> 00:51:41,140
I swear you're getting taller.

669
00:51:41,224 --> 00:51:42,517
[Paul] Well, you smell much worse.

670
00:51:47,146 --> 00:51:48,606
For four weeks, I lived with the Fremen.

671
00:51:49,023 --> 00:51:51,067
Hidden in the desert,
in a community called a <i>sietch.</i>

672
00:51:51,901 --> 00:51:54,487
Stilgar, the leader of that <i>sietch,</i>
has come with me to meet you, sire.

673
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:57,115
This <i>sietch,</i> how is it hidden?

674
00:51:57,448 --> 00:51:58,366
It's underground.

675
00:51:58,783 --> 00:52:00,159
Arrakis is filled with caverns.

676
00:52:00,535 --> 00:52:01,577
How big was the place?

677
00:52:02,495 --> 00:52:03,663
I'd say 10,000 people.

678
00:52:04,956 --> 00:52:06,124
And there are hundreds of <i>sietches.</i>

679
00:52:07,542 --> 00:52:09,043
Millions of Fremen.

680
00:52:09,836 --> 00:52:10,837
You were right.

681
00:52:10,962 --> 00:52:14,340
The Harkonnen estimate
was 50,000 on the whole planet.

682
00:52:14,966 --> 00:52:16,676
The Fremen watched me
search for them for days.

683
00:52:17,135 --> 00:52:18,177
I never saw them.

684
00:52:18,928 --> 00:52:20,638
Finally, they sent
a warrior out to kill me.

685
00:52:21,639 --> 00:52:22,557
And I gotta tell you,

686
00:52:23,349 --> 00:52:24,934
I have never come so close to dying.

687
00:52:25,852 --> 00:52:27,520
There's no finer fighter
in the Imperium.

688
00:52:28,563 --> 00:52:29,731
They fight like demons.

689
00:52:30,356 --> 00:52:31,524
Desert power.

690
00:52:34,402 --> 00:52:35,445
Duncan.

691
00:52:36,404 --> 00:52:37,822
- Well done.
- Thank you, my lord.

692
00:52:37,905 --> 00:52:38,906
[man] Sire.

693
00:52:39,615 --> 00:52:41,492
Their leader has a knife
he won't surrender, sire.

694
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:44,370
It's a crysknife.
It's sacred to his people.

695
00:52:45,038 --> 00:52:46,039
Let him pass.

696
00:53:02,722 --> 00:53:03,681
[Gurney] Stop there.

697
00:53:04,474 --> 00:53:05,850
Hey! Hey!

698
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:10,521
Mm.

699
00:53:11,397 --> 00:53:12,523
[Leto] Stilgar.

700
00:53:13,483 --> 00:53:14,650
Welcome.

701
00:53:16,194 --> 00:53:18,321
Sir, I respect the personal dignity

702
00:53:18,404 --> 00:53:19,822
of any man that respects mine.

703
00:53:21,657 --> 00:53:23,201
[inhales deeply]

704
00:53:23,451 --> 00:53:24,452
[Stilgar] Hmm.

705
00:53:25,912 --> 00:53:27,330
[inhales deeply]

706
00:53:27,789 --> 00:53:28,790
[Duncan] Hold.

707
00:53:30,708 --> 00:53:32,168
[clears throat] Thank you, Stilgar,

708
00:53:32,710 --> 00:53:35,338
for the gift of your body's moisture.

709
00:53:36,422 --> 00:53:38,257
We accept it in the spirit
in which it was given.

710
00:53:44,180 --> 00:53:45,098
[Leto snorts]

711
00:53:46,516 --> 00:53:47,517
[Leto] I'm glad you've come.

712
00:53:48,601 --> 00:53:50,061
I believe your people and mine

713
00:53:50,603 --> 00:53:51,813
have much to offer one another.

714
00:53:51,938 --> 00:53:53,231
No, no, you are Outworlders.

715
00:53:53,398 --> 00:53:54,982
You come here for the spice,

716
00:53:55,066 --> 00:53:57,110
you take it, giving nothing in return.

717
00:53:59,320 --> 00:54:00,321
That's true.

718
00:54:02,615 --> 00:54:05,159
I know you've suffered
at the hands of the Harkonnen.

719
00:54:06,452 --> 00:54:07,537
Name what you want.

720
00:54:07,995 --> 00:54:10,123
If it's in my power to grant,
I'll give it and ask for nothing.

721
00:54:10,248 --> 00:54:13,459
Mm. I ask for this.
Do not seek our <i>sietches.</i>

722
00:54:13,543 --> 00:54:16,170
Do not trespass in our lands.

723
00:54:16,879 --> 00:54:19,882
The desert was ours
long before you came.

724
00:54:20,049 --> 00:54:22,885
So, come and dig your spice,
but when you have it,

725
00:54:22,969 --> 00:54:25,346
go back to this side of the Shield Wall

726
00:54:25,513 --> 00:54:27,432
and leave the desert to the Fremen.

727
00:54:27,598 --> 00:54:30,184
You will address the Duke
as "my lord" or "sire."

728
00:54:30,268 --> 00:54:32,019
[Leto] Gurney, just...
just a moment.

729
00:54:32,937 --> 00:54:34,105
The Emperor

730
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:36,858
has given me Arrakis as my fief

731
00:54:37,358 --> 00:54:38,651
to rule and protect.

732
00:54:39,193 --> 00:54:41,320
I cannot promise
not to travel into the desert

733
00:54:41,487 --> 00:54:43,072
if duty compels me.

734
00:54:44,657 --> 00:54:46,534
But your <i>sietches</i> will be yours forever.

735
00:54:47,910 --> 00:54:49,912
And you will never be hunted
while I govern here.

736
00:54:54,750 --> 00:54:55,960
That's very honorable.

737
00:54:56,961 --> 00:54:59,213
I must go. That's all
I have to say to you.

738
00:54:59,422 --> 00:55:00,381
[Paul] Won't you stay?

739
00:55:01,382 --> 00:55:02,425
We would honor you.

740
00:55:03,259 --> 00:55:05,470
Honor requires that I be elsewhere.

741
00:55:06,804 --> 00:55:07,805
[speaking Chakobsa]

742
00:55:17,773 --> 00:55:18,816
I don't like him.

743
00:55:19,150 --> 00:55:21,152
Our plan bears fruit.

744
00:55:21,444 --> 00:55:22,570
But it will take time?

745
00:55:23,029 --> 00:55:23,988
Yes.

746
00:55:25,156 --> 00:55:27,033
It will take time.

747
00:55:30,161 --> 00:55:31,370
Here, this is for you.

748
00:55:35,541 --> 00:55:36,584
It's a paracompass.

749
00:55:37,752 --> 00:55:39,837
The moons here
have a magnetic field, so...

750
00:55:40,338 --> 00:55:41,881
a simple compass needle
won't point north.

751
00:55:43,174 --> 00:55:44,884
Takes a clever piece
of clockwork to sort it out.

752
00:55:45,259 --> 00:55:46,427
[Paul] The Fremen make these?

753
00:55:47,261 --> 00:55:48,721
And stillsuits, and sand compactors,

754
00:55:48,804 --> 00:55:50,056
and all kinds of ingenious things.

755
00:55:50,389 --> 00:55:52,099
[Gurney] What the hell
is a sand compactor?

756
00:55:54,644 --> 00:55:55,645
[Duncan] That's a sand compactor.

757
00:55:55,853 --> 00:55:56,729
[all chuckle]

758
00:55:57,104 --> 00:55:59,190
My God, man, you've gone native.

759
00:55:59,815 --> 00:56:00,775
You admire them.

760
00:56:02,443 --> 00:56:03,361
I do.

761
00:56:04,237 --> 00:56:05,947
They're fierce but loyal.

762
00:56:06,822 --> 00:56:08,032
They're attuned to the desert.

763
00:56:08,616 --> 00:56:09,492
Part of it.

764
00:56:10,076 --> 00:56:11,077
It's part of them.

765
00:56:12,286 --> 00:56:13,204
You wait till you see it.

766
00:56:14,288 --> 00:56:15,248
It's beautiful out there.

767
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:20,670
[announcer] <i>Sunrise warning,
all workers.</i>

768
00:56:21,087 --> 00:56:23,631

[dramatic music continues]

774
00:57:05,214 --> 00:57:06,674
The Judge of the Change, sire.

775
00:57:07,300 --> 00:57:08,342
Dr. Liet Kynes.

776
00:57:09,093 --> 00:57:10,261
My lord Duke.

777
00:57:11,512 --> 00:57:12,513
Welcome to Arrakis.

778
00:57:13,347 --> 00:57:14,724
[Paul] You're the Imperial Ecologist.

779
00:57:15,391 --> 00:57:16,767
Thank you for the stillsuits.

780
00:57:17,351 --> 00:57:18,644
They are of Fremen make.

781
00:57:19,312 --> 00:57:20,146
The best.

782
00:57:20,479 --> 00:57:21,689
With your permission, sire,

783
00:57:21,772 --> 00:57:23,024
I must check
the integrity of your suit...

784
00:57:23,608 --> 00:57:24,650
[Leto] Whoa.

785
00:57:25,109 --> 00:57:26,110
It's all right.

786
00:57:28,321 --> 00:57:29,363
It's all right.

787
00:57:30,239 --> 00:57:33,618
[chuckles lightly] Dr. Kynes,
we're in your hands.

788
00:57:38,581 --> 00:57:42,710
A stillsuit is a high-efficiency
filtration system.

789
00:57:43,919 --> 00:57:45,463
Even this early in the morning,

790
00:57:45,630 --> 00:57:47,965
you wouldn't survive two hours
without one of these.

791
00:57:49,258 --> 00:57:50,217
It cools the body

792
00:57:51,761 --> 00:57:54,096
and recycles
the water lost to sweat.

793
00:57:55,640 --> 00:57:57,892
Your body's movements
provide the power.

794
00:57:58,934 --> 00:58:00,269
Inside the mask, you'll find a tube

795
00:58:00,353 --> 00:58:02,605
to allow you to drink
the recycled water.

796
00:58:02,730 --> 00:58:03,731
[Leto] Mm.

797
00:58:03,856 --> 00:58:05,316
In good working order,
your suit won't lose

798
00:58:05,399 --> 00:58:07,193
more than a thimbleful of water a day.

799
00:58:07,860 --> 00:58:08,778
[Leto] Most impressive.

800
00:58:11,113 --> 00:58:12,198
Let's have a look at you, lad.

801
00:58:14,700 --> 00:58:15,743
You've...

802
00:58:16,369 --> 00:58:17,370
worn a stillsuit before?

803
00:58:17,453 --> 00:58:18,579
No, this is my first time.

804
00:58:21,499 --> 00:58:24,085
Your desert boots are fitted
slip-fashion at the ankles.

805
00:58:24,210 --> 00:58:25,211
Who taught you to do that?

806
00:58:26,087 --> 00:58:27,213
It seemed the right way.

807
00:58:29,340 --> 00:58:30,341
[speaking Chakobsa]

808
00:58:35,554 --> 00:58:36,597
[in English] Are you Fremen?

809
00:58:38,683 --> 00:58:41,560
I am accepted
in both <i>sietch</i> and village.

810
00:58:42,687 --> 00:58:47,566
Now, come and see the spice sands
on which your livelihood depends.

811
00:58:52,863 --> 00:58:54,865
[dramatic music playing]

812
00:59:26,021 --> 00:59:26,939
What would you do

813
00:59:27,022 --> 00:59:28,566
if your ornithopter went down out here?

814
00:59:29,316 --> 00:59:30,776
You wouldn't want
to go down out there.

815
00:59:31,777 --> 00:59:32,778
It's worm territory.

816
00:59:35,698 --> 00:59:36,699
Dust cloud.

817
00:59:37,742 --> 00:59:38,743
[Leto] I see it.

818
00:59:40,703 --> 00:59:42,246
That's one of your harvesters.

819
00:59:45,166 --> 00:59:46,459
[dramatic music continues]

820
01:00:00,097 --> 01:00:01,932
[machinery clunking]

821
01:00:08,355 --> 01:00:09,440
[Dr. Kynes] You can see the spice

822
01:00:09,523 --> 01:00:10,649
scattered over the surface.

823
01:00:12,860 --> 01:00:14,236
A rich spice bed

824
01:00:14,945 --> 01:00:16,197
by the color.

825
01:00:16,363 --> 01:00:18,699
If you get a little higher,
you'll have a better view.

826
01:00:33,881 --> 01:00:36,175
You see these spotter aircraft
looking for wormsign.

827
01:00:38,219 --> 01:00:39,220
[Paul] Wormsign?

828
01:00:39,762 --> 01:00:41,722
A sand wave
moving toward the crawler.

829
01:00:42,348 --> 01:00:44,308
Worms travel deep but get closer

830
01:00:44,391 --> 01:00:45,643
to the surface when they attack.

831
01:00:46,685 --> 01:00:47,937
If you are patient,

832
01:00:49,146 --> 01:00:50,314
we should see one.

833
01:00:51,232 --> 01:00:52,399
A worm always comes?

834
01:00:52,733 --> 01:00:55,152
Always. They're drawn
by rhythmic noises.

835
01:00:55,778 --> 01:00:57,279
[Paul] Why don't we just
shield the crawlers?

836
01:00:57,780 --> 01:00:59,907
A shield's a death sentence
in the desert.

837
01:01:00,407 --> 01:01:01,534
It attracts the worms

838
01:01:01,659 --> 01:01:03,911
and drives them into a killing frenzy.

839
01:01:06,789 --> 01:01:07,790
Is that a worm?

840
01:01:20,219 --> 01:01:21,303
[Dr. Kynes] Big one.

841
01:01:22,137 --> 01:01:23,264
You have good eyes.

842
01:01:24,640 --> 01:01:26,559
Calling crawler Delta Ajax niner.

843
01:01:26,934 --> 01:01:28,561
Wormsign warning. Acknowledge.

846
01:01:33,148 --> 01:01:34,608
They seem pretty calm about it.

[Dr. Kynes] Unlisted flight.

So, what happens now?

01:01:58,632 --> 01:02:00,634
They'll call a carryall
to lift the crawler.

858
01:02:01,385 --> 01:02:03,178
They'll harvest right up
to the last minute.

With your own eyes. It's plain to see.

Everything they've left us

The desert's not kind
to humans either.

965
01:09:33,628 --> 01:09:35,881
Spice is a psychoactive chemical.

You can't know that.

I never questioned you.

1011

01:22:51,259 --> 01:22:54,053
For Paul. I will do what I can.

1080
01:22:54,887 --> 01:22:56,180
And you

1081
01:22:56,764 --> 01:22:58,099
will kill a man for me.

1082
01:23:03,104 --> 01:23:06,274
I'm going to replace your peg tooth.

1083
01:23:06,774 --> 01:23:10,236
If you bite down hard,
this tooth will crush.

1084
01:23:11,988 --> 01:23:15,408
Breathe out, and you will
fill the air with poison.

1085
01:23:16,325 --> 01:23:17,994
It will be your last breath.

1086
01:23:18,953 --> 01:23:20,830
But if you choose your moment well,

1087
01:23:22,540 --> 01:23:24,208
it will also be the Baron's.

1088
01:23:43,102 --> 01:23:44,478
[tense music playing]

1089
01:24:02,872 --> 01:24:03,873

1093
01:24:58,469 --> 01:24:59,553
Paul.

[alarm beeping]

1103
01:27:59,650 --> 01:28:01,735
[trooper 1 in English]
I've never had a highborn.

1104
01:28:04,613 --> 01:28:05,614
You?

1105
01:28:06,157 --> 01:28:07,658
Bene Gesserit ain't all highborn.

1106
01:28:08,659 --> 01:28:10,661
[trooper 1 ] She's highborn
enough for me.

1107
01:28:12,204 --> 01:28:13,998
Let's feed the kid to the worms.

1108
01:28:14,540 --> 01:28:16,292
And give her a long goodbye.

1109
01:28:16,584 --> 01:28:18,419
Don't you dare touch my mother.

1110
01:28:19,837 --> 01:28:20,796
Don't talk.

1111
01:28:25,843 --> 01:28:26,844
[in sign language]

1112
01:28:29,805 --> 01:28:30,806
[Paul sighs]

1113
01:28:32,558 --> 01:28:33,809
[sternly] Remove her gag.

1114
01:28:41,734 --> 01:28:42,568
[retches]

1115
01:28:43,277 --> 01:28:44,361

[Paul breathing deeply]

1120
01:29:13,599 --> 01:29:14,934
[distorted voice] Remove her gag.

1121
01:29:21,190 --> 01:29:22,191
[distorted voice] Kill him.

1122
01:29:31,283 --> 01:29:32,326

[Lady Jessica grunting]

1126
01:29:45,965 --> 01:29:46,924
[distorted voice] Stop!

1127
01:29:47,633 --> 01:29:48,759
Cut the rope.

1128
01:29:51,637 --> 01:29:52,638
Give me the knife.

1129
01:29:53,639 --> 01:29:54,890
[stabs]

1130
01:29:57,309 --> 01:29:58,310
[grunts]

1131
01:30:01,897 --> 01:30:04,483
[normal voice]
Your pitch was too forced.

1132
01:30:12,783 --> 01:30:13,993
[Paul] It's a fremkit.

1133
01:30:18,497 --> 01:30:20,291
[man speaks Harkonnen over radio]

1134
01:30:25,045 --> 01:30:26,255
[engine shuts off]

1135
01:30:27,339 --> 01:30:28,382
They've crippled the ship.

1136
01:30:44,148 --> 01:30:45,899
[distant explosions]

1137
01:30:53,907 --> 01:30:55,200

Ah.

[munching]

1147
01:32:04,019 --> 01:32:06,271
You have a wonderful kitchen, cousin.

1148
01:32:08,065 --> 01:32:09,316
[wind howling]

1149
01:32:14,321 --> 01:32:15,531
[Paul grunts]

1150
01:32:25,290 --> 01:32:27,000
This is Dr. Yueh's handwriting.

1151
01:32:28,252 --> 01:32:30,129
"If anyone makes it out
of Arrakeen alive,

1152
01:32:30,671 --> 01:32:32,464
there's an Atreides beacon
in the fremkit.

1153
01:32:33,048 --> 01:32:34,633
God willing,
they'll be able to find you."

1154
01:32:39,221 --> 01:32:40,723
[wheezing weakly]

1155
01:32:43,058 --> 01:32:44,059
My lord Baron.

1156
01:32:45,477 --> 01:32:46,645
Dr. Yueh.

1157
01:32:46,812 --> 01:32:47,980
[Vladimir] The traitor.

1158
01:32:49,648 --> 01:32:50,733
What do you want?

1159
01:32:51,984 --> 01:32:53,444
I jammed their comms

1160
01:32:54,361 --> 01:32:55,863
and lowered their shields.

1161
01:32:56,363 --> 01:32:57,406
[Vladimir] Hmm.

1162
01:32:57,489 --> 01:32:59,616
[Dr. Yueh] I delivered
the Duke and his family.

1163
01:33:00,159 --> 01:33:01,785
[Vladimir] The bargain to the letter.

1164
01:33:02,703 --> 01:33:03,829
And what was I to do for you?

1165
01:33:05,330 --> 01:33:07,332
Deliver my wife from her agony.

1166
01:33:09,334 --> 01:33:10,335
[Vladimir] Yes.

1167
01:33:12,838 --> 01:33:14,548
[slow sinister music playing]

1168
01:33:40,783 --> 01:33:43,285
[chewing loudly]

1169
01:33:44,036 --> 01:33:45,496
I said I'd set her free.

1170
01:33:46,580 --> 01:33:47,831
That you could join her.

1171
01:33:50,751 --> 01:33:52,085
[Dr. Yueh grunts]

1172
01:33:52,711 --> 01:33:53,837
So, join her.

1173

- [knife slices]
- [body thuds]

1174
01:34:03,555 --> 01:34:05,057
What do you think is next?

1175
01:34:09,520 --> 01:34:10,646
[Paul] It's a thumper.

1176
01:34:11,605 --> 01:34:12,689
No stillsuits.

1177
01:34:13,357 --> 01:34:14,942
The one thing we actually need.

1178
01:34:20,322 --> 01:34:23,158
For hundreds of years,
we've traded blood for blood.

1179
01:34:24,827 --> 01:34:25,869
But no more.

1180
01:34:28,413 --> 01:34:31,124
Your son is dead.
Your concubine is dead.

1181
01:34:32,417 --> 01:34:34,753
Tonight the House of Atreides falls.

1182
01:34:37,965 --> 01:34:40,175
And your bloodline ends forever.

1183
01:34:42,761 --> 01:34:44,054
[Leto mumbling]

1184
01:34:54,231 --> 01:34:55,232
What did you say?

1185
01:35:05,242 --> 01:35:06,618
[softly] Here I am...

1186
01:35:08,161 --> 01:35:09,580
<i>here I remain.</i>

[Duncan] Kynes!

1196
01:36:55,811 --> 01:36:57,354
It's not safe for you here.

1197
01:36:57,521 --> 01:36:58,647
[Duncan] Will you tell
the Great Houses

1198
01:36:58,730 --> 01:37:00,232
of the Landsraad
how we were betrayed?

1199
01:37:00,816 --> 01:37:02,317
How the best of them were murdered?

1200
01:37:03,318 --> 01:37:05,320
I am commanded to say nothing.

1201
01:37:06,905 --> 01:37:08,240
To see nothing.

1202
01:37:10,450 --> 01:37:12,077
The Emperor sent us here to die.

1203
01:37:12,661 --> 01:37:14,162
[lamentation music continues]

1204
01:37:37,060 --> 01:37:38,270

[coughing]

1207
01:38:01,251 --> 01:38:02,544
[Paul] There's spice in the tent.

1208

1209
01:38:13,972 --> 01:38:15,057

[slow ominous music playing]

[thunder rumbling]

1221
01:40:03,123 --> 01:40:04,916
Paul, you're scared. I can see it.

1222
01:40:06,084 --> 01:40:07,669
Tell me, please, what do you fear?

1223
01:40:09,254 --> 01:40:10,589
[voices continue whispering]

1224
01:40:18,346 --> 01:40:20,223
Somebody help me, please.

Paul.

1226
01:40:24,728 --> 01:40:25,729
It's coming.

[Lady Jessica] Paul.

You are your father's son.
You are my son.

1239
01:40:54,591 --> 01:40:57,052
You are the Duke Paul Atreides.

You need to drink.

Sweat and tears.

1254
01:42:33,523 --> 01:42:34,858

1266
01:43:48,681 --> 01:43:49,808
That's Duncan.

1267

[panting]

1268
01:44:00,318 --> 01:44:01,486
My lady.

1269
01:44:01,653 --> 01:44:02,654
Paul.

1270
01:44:03,405 --> 01:44:05,198
I'm so sorry. Your father...

1271
01:44:05,573 --> 01:44:06,699
We know.

1272
01:44:08,743 --> 01:44:09,911
My lord Duke.

1273
01:44:23,508 --> 01:44:24,509
Here.

1274
01:44:26,636 --> 01:44:27,720
Drink this.

1275
01:44:35,603 --> 01:44:37,313
[Duncan] Harkonnens hit
every population center

1276
01:44:37,397 --> 01:44:38,731
on the planet at once.

1277
01:44:39,149 --> 01:44:41,568
There must have been
ten legions, hundreds of ships.

1278
01:44:41,734 --> 01:44:42,986
There were Sardaukar with them.

1279
01:44:43,862 --> 01:44:45,780
- At least two battalions.
- What? Are you sure?

1280
01:44:46,448 --> 01:44:48,116
You cross swords with a Sardaukar,

1281
01:44:49,117 --> 01:44:50,118
you know it.

1282
01:44:50,618 --> 01:44:53,663
[Lady Jessica sighs]
So, the Emperor's taken a side.

1283
01:44:55,498 --> 01:44:57,167
What says
the Judge of the Change?

1284
01:44:58,835 --> 01:45:00,753
The Emperor forbids me
from saying anything at all.

1285
01:45:00,920 --> 01:45:02,672
And yet you risk your life
to help us.

1286
01:45:11,181 --> 01:45:12,432
[thunder rumbling]

1287
01:45:17,562 --> 01:45:19,022

1289
01:45:23,234 --> 01:45:24,527
[worker] Storm's coming.

1290
01:45:28,072 --> 01:45:29,365
[workers shouting indistinctly]

1291
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:40,960
[Dr. Kynes] The storm
will be here in a few hours.

1292
01:45:41,127 --> 01:45:42,212
We'll be safe here.

1293
01:45:43,922 --> 01:45:45,507
Do you know what this place is?

1294
01:45:46,257 --> 01:45:48,510
It's an old ecological testing station.

1295
01:45:52,055 --> 01:45:53,806
They were meant to tame the planet.

1296
01:45:53,973 --> 01:45:55,892
Free the water locked beneath the sands.

1297
01:45:59,479 --> 01:46:01,397
Arrakis could have been a paradise.

1298
01:46:02,148 --> 01:46:04,943
The work had begun,
but then the spice was discovered.

1299
01:46:05,109 --> 01:46:07,320
And suddenly no one
wanted the desert to go away.

1300
01:46:07,987 --> 01:46:08,988
Tanat,

1301
01:46:09,072 --> 01:46:10,907
will you find stillsuits
to fit our visitors?

1302
01:46:10,990 --> 01:46:12,116
[Tanat] Yes, Liet.

1303
01:46:12,283 --> 01:46:13,660
[Dr. Kynes] Shamir,
a coffee service, please.

1304
01:46:13,826 --> 01:46:14,994
[Shamir] Of course, Liet.

1305
01:46:16,371 --> 01:46:18,498
- [door unlocks]
- Who are you to the Fremen?

1306
01:46:45,149 --> 01:46:46,901

1307
01:46:56,953 --> 01:46:58,454
[wind howling]

1308
01:47:09,716 --> 01:47:11,175
[Paul] You know what
the Great Houses fear most,

1309
01:47:11,259 --> 01:47:12,343
Dr. Kynes?

1310
01:47:14,429 --> 01:47:16,097
Exactly what has happened
to us here.

1311
01:47:17,599 --> 01:47:18,725
The Sardaukar coming

1312
01:47:18,808 --> 01:47:20,226
and picking them off
one by one.

1313
01:47:23,646 --> 01:47:25,148
Only together
can they stand a chance

1314
01:47:25,231 --> 01:47:26,274
against the Imperium.

1315
01:47:28,776 --> 01:47:30,028
Would you bear witness?

1316
01:47:31,154 --> 01:47:33,364
Testify that the Emperor
has moved against us here?

1317
01:47:34,240 --> 01:47:36,075
If they believe me,

1318
01:47:37,285 --> 01:47:38,995
there would be general warfare

1319
01:47:39,078 --> 01:47:41,080
between the Great Houses
and the Emperor.

1320
01:47:41,247 --> 01:47:42,373
Chaos

1321
01:47:42,957 --> 01:47:44,292
across the Imperium.

1322
01:47:44,584 --> 01:47:46,002
Suppose I presented the Emperor

1323
01:47:46,085 --> 01:47:47,337
with an alternative to chaos.

1324
01:47:48,588 --> 01:47:50,131
The Emperor has no sons.

1325
01:47:50,673 --> 01:47:52,091
And his daughters have yet to marry.

1326
01:47:52,717 --> 01:47:54,677
You'd make a play for the throne?

1327
01:47:55,637 --> 01:47:57,388
The Emperor feared the Atreides.

1328
01:47:57,472 --> 01:47:58,973
He brought you here to kill you.

1329
01:47:59,140 --> 01:48:00,725
What don't you understand?

1330
01:48:01,726 --> 01:48:04,395
You're a lost boy hiding
in a hole in the ground.

1331
01:48:09,275 --> 01:48:11,694
The Fremen speak
of the <i>Lisan al-Gaib.</i>

1332
01:48:12,695 --> 01:48:13,946
Careful.

1333
01:48:14,739 --> 01:48:17,533
The Voice from the Outer World
who will lead them to paradise.

1334
01:48:19,410 --> 01:48:20,578
Superstition.

1335
01:48:25,500 --> 01:48:27,210
I know you loved a Fremen warrior

1336
01:48:27,293 --> 01:48:28,503
and lost him in battle.

1337
01:48:31,964 --> 01:48:35,134
I know you walk in two worlds
and are known by many names.

1338
01:48:40,765 --> 01:48:42,225
I've seen your dream.

1339
01:48:46,896 --> 01:48:47,980
As emperor, Dr. Kynes,

1340
01:48:48,147 --> 01:48:49,982
I could make a paradise of Arrakis

1341
01:48:50,066 --> 01:48:51,317
with a wave of my hand.

[Paul] Duncan, no!

1355
01:51:00,822 --> 01:51:03,074

[Paul] Duncan!

1364
01:51:55,167 --> 01:51:56,627
We have to go. We have no choice.

You'll find a thopter ready to fly.

Above 5,000 meters, it's mostly dust.

Climb into it. Stay on top.
Head south. Find the Fremen.

Are you not coming with us?

1378
01:53:12,912 --> 01:53:13,955
It only seats two.

1379
01:53:14,205 --> 01:53:15,665
I'll go to the next station

1380
01:53:16,082 --> 01:53:17,625

to the Landsraad.

1381

Fear is the mind-killer.

Winds at 800 kilometers an hour.

1439
02:00:01,111 --> 02:00:02,654
Nothing survives such a storm.

1440
02:00:03,364 --> 02:00:04,281
They're dead.

1441
02:00:06,241 --> 02:00:07,326
It's a certainty.

1442
02:00:12,623 --> 02:00:13,582
[grunts]

1443
02:00:15,042 --> 02:00:16,752
So, it's done. Finally.

1444
02:00:19,630 --> 02:00:21,131
Send word to Giedi Prime

1445
02:00:21,590 --> 02:00:23,592
to begin selling our spice reserves.

1446
02:00:25,177 --> 02:00:26,136
But slowly.

1447
02:00:27,513 --> 02:00:28,972
We don't want the price to fall.

1448
02:00:30,099 --> 02:00:31,475
You have no idea how much it cost me

1449
02:00:31,558 --> 02:00:33,352
to bring such a force to bear here.

1450
02:00:34,395 --> 02:00:36,063
Now I only have one requirement.

1451
02:00:37,189 --> 02:00:38,273
Income.

1452
02:00:39,316 --> 02:00:40,692
So, squeeze, Rabban.

1453
02:00:41,819 --> 02:00:42,986
Squeeze hard.

1454
02:00:43,362 --> 02:00:44,405
Yes, Uncle.

1455
02:00:46,323 --> 02:00:47,408
And the Fremen?

1456
02:00:48,575 --> 02:00:49,660
Kill them all.

1457
02:00:54,164 --> 02:00:55,290
[wind gusting]

1458
02:01:05,801 --> 02:01:06,718
[alarm beeping rapidly]

1459
02:01:13,350 --> 02:01:14,726
[Paul] We're above 5,000 meters.

1460
02:01:23,068 --> 02:01:24,027
[engine roars]

1461
02:01:27,030 --> 02:01:27,865
[exhales sharply]

1462
02:01:34,621 --> 02:01:35,664
[ornithopter rattling]

1463
02:01:35,747 --> 02:01:36,915
[Paul grunting]

1464
02:01:47,384 --> 02:01:48,552
[engine roaring]

1465
02:01:50,012 --> 02:01:51,388
[alarm beeping rapidly]

1466
02:01:53,765 --> 02:01:54,766
[sputtering]

1467
02:01:56,018 --> 02:01:57,102
- [metallic rattling]
- [gasping]

1468
02:01:57,644 --> 02:01:58,645
[gasps]

1469
02:01:59,563 --> 02:02:00,814
[alarm continues beeping]

1470
02:02:01,648 --> 02:02:02,649
[switches click]

1471
02:02:02,733 --> 02:02:03,942
[alarm stops beeping]

1472
02:02:09,156 --> 02:02:10,240
[soft rattling]

1473
02:02:17,539 --> 02:02:18,624
[wind whistling]

1474
02:02:23,212 --> 02:02:24,171
[rattling]

1475
02:02:27,174 --> 02:02:28,717
[both gasping]

1476
02:02:31,929 --> 02:02:33,138
[engine whines]

1477
02:02:52,950 --> 02:02:54,701
[Paul] As soon as we land,
run for the rocks.

1478
02:03:05,837 --> 02:03:07,297
[engine accelerates]

1479
02:03:09,132 --> 02:03:10,259
[Lady Jessica whimpering]

1480
02:03:16,598 --> 02:03:17,641
[engine roaring]

1481
02:04:00,183 --> 02:04:01,810
[both panting]

1482
02:04:47,814 --> 02:04:49,024
And breathe through this.

1483
02:05:04,081 --> 02:05:05,248
[rumbling]

1484
02:05:20,055 --> 02:05:21,640
[Paul over mask]
Now we have to find the Fremen.

1485
02:05:23,600 --> 02:05:24,768
Are you good?

1486
02:05:24,935 --> 02:05:25,852
[Lady Jessica] Yeah.

1487
02:05:26,478 --> 02:05:28,188
[slow suspenseful music playing]

1488
02:06:33,170 --> 02:06:34,504
[voices echoing] <i>Paul...</i>

1489
02:06:41,470 --> 02:06:44,222
<i>Don't be frightened.</i>

1490
02:06:45,849 --> 02:06:48,518
[girl] <i>Even a little
desert mouse can survive.</i>

1491
02:06:49,644 --> 02:06:52,856
[voices] <i>Don't be frightened.</i>

1492
02:06:53,273 --> 02:06:54,649
[girl] <i>You'll need to face your fears.</i>

1493
02:06:55,025 --> 02:06:56,234
[voices] <i>A friend...</i>

1494
02:06:56,860 --> 02:06:59,404
<i>A friend will help you.</i>

1495
02:07:01,364 --> 02:07:02,741
<i>Follow the friend.</i>

1496
02:07:06,119 --> 02:07:07,120
[Jamis] <i>You have much to learn.</i>

1497
02:07:09,581 --> 02:07:11,416
And I will show you
the ways of the desert.

1498
02:07:15,462 --> 02:07:16,546
Come with me.

1499
02:07:23,094 --> 02:07:24,596
[mysterious music playing]

1500
02:07:45,033 --> 02:07:47,327
[Paul] The <i>sietch</i> where Duncan lived

1501
02:07:48,703 --> 02:07:49,871
is somewhere off that way.

1502
02:07:53,166 --> 02:07:54,793
[Lady Jessica] I can see
greenery over there.

1503
02:07:56,044 --> 02:07:56,920
There.

1504
02:07:57,087 --> 02:07:58,421
[Paul] That means Fremen live there.

1505
02:08:03,677 --> 02:08:04,886
We'll cross after dark.

1506
02:08:05,971 --> 02:08:07,097
That's how the Fremen do it.

1507
02:08:10,892 --> 02:08:12,686
[Paul] We're about to enter
worm territory.

1508
02:08:13,562 --> 02:08:15,146
We can't walk like regular humans.

1509
02:08:15,522 --> 02:08:16,481
If we do, we're dead.

1510
02:08:16,982 --> 02:08:18,483
We'll have to walk like the Fremen do.

1511
02:08:18,859 --> 02:08:20,068
It's called a sandwalk.

1512
02:08:20,652 --> 02:08:22,487
At least according
to the filmbooks back home.

1513
02:08:23,321 --> 02:08:24,573
[Lady Jessica] Yeah. Yeah, okay.

1514
02:08:24,739 --> 02:08:26,032
[Paul] Okay. Follow me.

1515
02:08:26,366 --> 02:08:27,617
Do the same moves.

1516
02:08:39,379 --> 02:08:40,505
[compass ticking]

1517
02:08:41,590 --> 02:08:42,841
I think this is the right direction.

1518
02:09:03,028 --> 02:09:04,613
[both grunting]

1519
02:09:17,584 --> 02:09:18,960
[panting]

1520
02:09:28,178 --> 02:09:29,512
[distant rumbling]

1521
02:09:39,064 --> 02:09:40,148
[rumbling fades]

1522
02:10:05,507 --> 02:10:06,508
[Paul] It's close by.

1523
02:10:07,467 --> 02:10:08,677
Let's get out of here.

1524
02:10:10,220 --> 02:10:11,846
- [thud]
- Wait.

1525
02:10:13,264 --> 02:10:15,016
- [hollow thudding]
- It's drum sand.

1526
02:10:15,350 --> 02:10:16,351
[wind gusting]

1527
02:10:19,688 --> 02:10:20,814
- [gasps]
- [Paul] Run.

1528
02:10:21,690 --> 02:10:22,816
[tense music playing]

1529
02:10:27,612 --> 02:10:28,905
[Lady Jessica] Go! Go!

1530
02:10:38,164 --> 02:10:39,290
[grunts]

1531
02:10:40,083 --> 02:10:41,751
[whimpering]

1532
02:11:04,190 --> 02:11:05,400
[rumbling stops]

1533
02:11:10,071 --> 02:11:11,406
[panting]

1534
02:11:13,408 --> 02:11:14,743
[sandworm moans]

02:11:33,511 --> 02:11:34,512
[thumping stops]

1538
02:11:38,433 --> 02:11:40,894
[soft rhythmic thumping]

1539
02:11:41,144 --> 02:11:42,187
[Paul] It's a thumper.

1540
02:11:47,859 --> 02:11:49,152
Someone set off a thumper.

1541
02:11:51,613 --> 02:11:52,697
[thumping fades]

1542
02:11:55,492 --> 02:11:57,285
[rhythmic thumping]

02:11:58,328 --> 02:11:59,412
[thumping stops]

1544
02:12:04,125 --> 02:12:06,127
[Lady Jessica] Paul! Run!

1545
02:12:17,889 --> 02:12:19,224
[both panting]

1546
02:12:21,226 --> 02:12:22,185
How big are they?

1547
02:12:22,435 --> 02:12:23,520
That was insane.

1548
02:12:26,856 --> 02:12:27,732
[groans]

1549
02:12:28,566 --> 02:12:29,484
Someone called it.

1550
02:12:32,487 --> 02:12:33,404
[Lady Jessica pants]

1551
02:12:39,119 --> 02:12:40,078
[in sign language]

1552
02:12:46,292 --> 02:12:47,293
[pebble clatters]

[footsteps]

1554
02:13:02,350 --> 02:13:03,601
[Stilgar over mask] <i>Do not run.</i>

1555
02:13:05,061 --> 02:13:07,355
<i>You will only waste
your body's water.</i>

1556
02:13:08,523 --> 02:13:09,399
<i>Hold.</i>

1557
02:13:17,198 --> 02:13:18,199
Stilgar.

1558
02:13:18,283 --> 02:13:19,284
- [blade rustles]
- Hey!

1559
02:13:19,909 --> 02:13:21,244
You know me. I was there

1560
02:13:21,327 --> 02:13:22,537
when you came
to my father's Council.

1561
02:13:22,829 --> 02:13:23,705
[Stilgar] Oh.

1562
02:13:23,997 --> 02:13:25,540
This is the Duke's son.

1563
02:13:26,207 --> 02:13:27,208
[Jamis] Why are you waiting?

1564
02:13:27,959 --> 02:13:29,043
We need their water.

1565
02:13:30,003 --> 02:13:31,713
[Stilgar] This is the boy
I told you about.

1566
02:13:32,255 --> 02:13:33,423
We can't touch him.

1567
02:13:33,506 --> 02:13:34,424
[woman speaking Fremen]

1568
02:13:37,969 --> 02:13:39,137
[Jamis in English] They are weaklings.

1569
02:13:39,304 --> 02:13:40,138
[Stilgar] Jamis.

1570
02:13:41,222 --> 02:13:43,099
That was a brave crossing they made

1571
02:13:43,183 --> 02:13:44,809
in the path of <i>Shai-Hulud.</i>

1572
02:13:46,186 --> 02:13:48,563
He does not speak
or act like a weakling.

1573
02:13:50,273 --> 02:13:51,482
Nor did his father.

1574
02:13:52,150 --> 02:13:53,443
[Jamis] My thumper saved his life.

1575
02:13:54,819 --> 02:13:56,487
Go back to reason, Stilgar.

1576
02:13:57,280 --> 02:13:58,323
He's not The One.

1577
02:14:00,658 --> 02:14:01,659
[sighs]

1578
02:14:01,743 --> 02:14:03,036
We have powerful friends.

1579
02:14:03,620 --> 02:14:06,247
You help us off-world, to Caladan,

1580
02:14:06,831 --> 02:14:08,041
you will be well rewarded.

1581
02:14:08,208 --> 02:14:10,585
What wealth can you offer
beyond the water

1582
02:14:10,960 --> 02:14:12,045
in your flesh?

1583
02:14:15,298 --> 02:14:16,382
[Stilgar] Hmm...

1584
02:14:17,425 --> 02:14:18,551
The boy is young.

1585
02:14:19,177 --> 02:14:20,678
He can learn our ways.

1586
02:14:21,471 --> 02:14:22,805
He may have sanctuary.

1587
02:14:24,224 --> 02:14:26,434
But the woman is untrained...

1588
02:14:29,187 --> 02:14:30,521
and too old to learn.

1589
02:14:34,359 --> 02:14:35,735
[low tense music playing]

1590
02:14:43,243 --> 02:14:44,410
[sniffles]

1591
02:14:49,624 --> 02:14:50,833
[grunting]

1592
02:14:56,923 --> 02:14:57,924
[groans]

1593
02:15:01,970 --> 02:15:03,888
- [both grunt]
- [Stilgar] Back, you dogs.

1594
02:15:05,598 --> 02:15:06,766
She'll cut my throat.

1595
02:15:12,897 --> 02:15:15,149
Why didn't you say
you were a weirding woman?

1596
02:15:15,608 --> 02:15:16,567
And a fighter?

1597
02:15:17,110 --> 02:15:18,569
Conversation ran short.

1598
02:15:19,362 --> 02:15:20,947
[Stilgar] Peace, woman.

1599
02:15:21,572 --> 02:15:22,699
Peace.

1600
02:15:23,741 --> 02:15:25,243
I judged hastily.

1601
02:15:29,330 --> 02:15:30,415
[sniffs]

1602
02:15:31,624 --> 02:15:32,834
[Stilgar grunts]

1603
02:15:33,293 --> 02:15:34,294
[speaking Chakobsa]

1604
02:16:04,949 --> 02:16:06,868
[girl in English] <i>I would not
have let you hurt my friends.</i>

1605
02:16:32,393 --> 02:16:33,728
They say you're the <i>Mahdi.</i>

1606
02:16:35,104 --> 02:16:36,647
But you look like a little boy.

1607
02:16:38,274 --> 02:16:39,567
You chose the hardest way up.

1608
02:16:39,901 --> 02:16:40,777
Follow me.

1609
02:16:43,613 --> 02:16:44,614
[Stilgar speaking Chakobsa]

1610
02:16:48,576 --> 02:16:49,744
[in English] Give it to me.

1611
02:16:57,377 --> 02:16:58,795
You will have your own maula pistol

1612
02:16:58,878 --> 02:17:00,088
when you've earned it.

1613
02:17:00,963 --> 02:17:01,964
Give it to me.

1614
02:17:07,970 --> 02:17:09,806
Chani, take charge of the newcomers.

1615
02:17:10,181 --> 02:17:12,225
See that they are safe
on the journey. Let's go.

1616
02:17:12,642 --> 02:17:13,851
[Jamis] I will not have them.

1617
02:17:20,900 --> 02:17:21,901
[Stilgar] Jamis,

1618
02:17:22,568 --> 02:17:24,612
I have spoken. Be still.

1619
02:17:24,904 --> 02:17:26,364
[Jamis] You talk like a leader.

1620
02:17:27,782 --> 02:17:29,242
But the strongest leads.

1621
02:17:30,910 --> 02:17:32,036
She bested you.

1622
02:17:33,955 --> 02:17:35,164
I invoke the amtal.

1623
02:17:36,332 --> 02:17:38,626
[Stilgar] You may not challenge
<i>a Sayyadina.</i>

1624
02:17:38,793 --> 02:17:40,044
Then who will fight in her name?

1625
02:17:40,586 --> 02:17:42,380
Jamis, don't do this.

1626
02:17:43,297 --> 02:17:45,216
Don't. The night is fading.

1627
02:17:45,383 --> 02:17:47,927
Then the sun will witness this death.

1628
02:17:48,594 --> 02:17:49,846
Where is her champion?

1629
02:18:01,357 --> 02:18:02,733
I accept her champion.

1630
02:18:26,382 --> 02:18:28,050
[slow dramatic music playing]

1631
02:18:32,597 --> 02:18:33,764
[grunting]

1632
02:18:35,433 --> 02:18:38,186
[voices] <i>Paul Atreides must die...</i>

1633
02:18:41,105 --> 02:18:45,568
<i>for</i> Kwisatz Haderach <i>to rise.</i>

1634
02:18:48,529 --> 02:18:51,324
<i>Don't be frightened.</i>

1635
02:18:52,325 --> 02:18:53,701
<i>Don't resist.</i>

1636
02:18:59,999 --> 02:19:01,959
<i>When you take a life,</i>

1637
02:19:03,002 --> 02:19:04,754
<i>you take your own.</i>

1638
02:19:12,553 --> 02:19:13,513
[moans]

1639
02:19:27,985 --> 02:19:29,153
[breathing heavily]

1640
02:19:36,702 --> 02:19:38,371
I don't believe
you're the <i>Lisan al-Gaib.</i>

1641
02:19:40,623 --> 02:19:42,166
But I want you to die with honor.

1642
02:19:54,136 --> 02:19:56,514
This crysknife was given to me
by my great aunt.

1643
02:20:00,226 --> 02:20:02,061
It's made from a tooth of <i>Shai-Hulud.</i>

1644
02:20:02,687 --> 02:20:03,813
The great sandworm.

1645
02:20:06,023 --> 02:20:08,109
This will be a great honor,
for you to die holding it.

1646
02:20:13,239 --> 02:20:14,824
[Jamis shouts]
Where is the Outworlder?

1647
02:20:19,745 --> 02:20:21,080
Jamis is a good fighter.

1648
02:20:22,707 --> 02:20:23,749
He won't let you suffer.

1649
02:20:25,793 --> 02:20:26,877
Chani...

1650
02:20:30,339 --> 02:20:31,173
Um...

1651
02:20:37,138 --> 02:20:38,139
[scoffs]

1652
02:20:39,557 --> 02:20:40,433
Never mind.

1653
02:20:53,487 --> 02:20:54,989
[slow dramatic music continues]

1654
02:21:36,614 --> 02:21:37,907
May thy knife chip and shatter.

1655
02:21:46,248 --> 02:21:47,708
You should welcome my blade.

1656
02:21:51,629 --> 02:21:52,963
This world will kill you.

1657
02:21:56,717 --> 02:21:57,885
Quicker this way.

1658
02:22:05,601 --> 02:22:06,727
[spectators speak Chakobsa in unison]

1659
02:22:09,563 --> 02:22:10,981
- [man speaks Chakobsa]
- [Jamis grunting]

1660
02:22:16,445 --> 02:22:17,863
[breathing heavily]

1661
02:22:38,050 --> 02:22:39,635
- Do you yield?
- [spectators exclaim]

1662
02:22:39,719 --> 02:22:41,929
[Stilgar speaking Chakobsa]

1663
02:22:42,012 --> 02:22:43,639
[Stilgar in English]
The boy doesn't know our rule.

1664
02:22:43,723 --> 02:22:44,724
[yells]

1665
02:22:44,807 --> 02:22:46,642
There's no yielding
under the amtal rule.

1666
02:22:46,809 --> 02:22:48,310
Only death is the test of it.

1667
02:22:48,519 --> 02:22:49,478
[Jamis yelling]

1668
02:22:53,149 --> 02:22:54,608
[both grunting]

1669
02:22:56,902 --> 02:22:58,612
- Is he toying with him?
- No.

1670
02:23:00,448 --> 02:23:01,449
Paul has never killed a man.

1671
02:23:03,826 --> 02:23:04,994
[both grunt]

1672
02:23:07,079 --> 02:23:08,038
[yelling]

1673
02:23:10,458 --> 02:23:12,084
[dramatic lamentation music playing]

1674
02:23:12,543 --> 02:23:16,505
[voices] Kwisatz Haderach.

1675
02:23:16,964 --> 02:23:18,048
[yelling]

1676
02:23:19,967 --> 02:23:22,762
Kwisatz Haderach.

1677
02:23:23,137 --> 02:23:26,932
<i>Climb up. Rise.</i>

1678
02:23:28,851 --> 02:23:29,894
[stabs]

1679
02:23:30,603 --> 02:23:31,729
[grunts]

1680
02:23:48,954 --> 02:23:50,289
[Jamis groaning]

1681
02:24:03,719 --> 02:24:05,721
[mournful music playing]

1682
02:24:35,334 --> 02:24:37,086
[mournful music continues]

1683
02:25:14,790 --> 02:25:16,083
[speaking Chakobsa]

1684
02:25:19,837 --> 02:25:21,130
[in English] You're one of us now.

1685
02:25:21,714 --> 02:25:22,965
A life for a life.

1686
02:25:23,716 --> 02:25:25,259
Come with us to <i>Sietch</i> Tabr.

1687
02:25:25,509 --> 02:25:26,385
No.

1688
02:25:26,802 --> 02:25:27,970
Paul needs to get off-world.

1689
02:25:28,345 --> 02:25:30,264
You must have ways. You have smugglers,

1690
02:25:30,347 --> 02:25:31,390
you have ships.

1691
02:25:31,599 --> 02:25:32,766
- [Paul] No.
- [Lady Jessica] You have...

1692
02:25:33,934 --> 02:25:35,603
The Emperor sent us to this place.

1693
02:25:37,563 --> 02:25:38,772
And my father came,

1694
02:25:40,065 --> 02:25:41,400
not for spice,

1695
02:25:42,318 --> 02:25:43,611
not for the riches,

1696
02:25:45,029 --> 02:25:46,488
but for the strength of your people.

1697
02:25:50,159 --> 02:25:51,660
My road leads into the desert.

1698
02:25:54,914 --> 02:25:55,873
I can see it.

1699
02:25:58,626 --> 02:25:59,793
If you'll have us,

1700
02:26:01,337 --> 02:26:02,338
we will come.

1701
02:26:09,219 --> 02:26:10,471
[slow dramatic music playing]

1702
02:26:51,637 --> 02:26:52,638
Desert power.

1703
02:26:54,390 --> 02:26:55,641
This is only the beginning.
