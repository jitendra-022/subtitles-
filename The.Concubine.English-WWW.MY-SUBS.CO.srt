Underage viewing prohibited.

2
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:29,380
English subtitles and timing by elee
I got sick and tire of the horrible subtitle work done by studios.

3
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:38,690
All subtitle work dedicated to my J
 Sit back and enjoy the movie :)

4
00:00:38,690 --> 00:00:48,240

Do you need sub work for other movies?
Make your request to elee@simplymenu.com

6
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:20,940
It's that way.

7
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:15,020
Open my ears as big as a donkey and 
so I may hear what my people are saying.

8
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:32,740
THE CONCUBINE 
Concubine to the King
Korean movie - 2012

9
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:45,350
Once again, I am so sorry.

10
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:49,080
That one doesn't know front from back.

11
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:53,700
It would have been nice to have your son join us, as well.

12
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:56,800
No, not at all.  He isn't my son at all.

13
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:03,300
When I was at the war front, he saved my life once 
so I brought him back and treat him like my own son.

14
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:06,020
You've ruined his hunting game. Let's go.  Now.

15
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,260
I'm so afraid. *** sarcastically ***

16
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:10,670
What?  A prince? He is nothing but a thug!

17
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:12,670
You are unworthy of being here!

18
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:16,950
You there!  Take your hands off of him.

19
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,870
What have I done to deserve this?

20
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:24,420
Are you saying even the deer is first for the prince?

21
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,350
Why you still...!

22
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:28,750
Take him out and lock him in the storage.

23
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:29,210
Yes sir.

24
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:30,550
Is that you, Kwon-yoo?

25
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:52,030
Please forgive me.  I've wrong you by not teaching the lower ones.

26
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:55,430
Please forgive me.

27
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:03,900
I told you to stay away from here 'til he leaves.

28
00:04:07,850 --> 00:04:13,110
What? What are you worried about?

29
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,110
Don't worry.

30
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:34,980
I hear you are not reading lately.
Is it true that you your time is consumed by hunting?

31
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:41,720
I was trying to broaden my view like 
others by not focusing on study alone...

32
00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:48,220
Was I really asking you that?

33
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:53,840
What is the reason you keep going to the Shin family's house?

34
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,870
Is it because of his daughter?

35
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,000
Only the Shin family...

36
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:13,350
She is the first one that I like...

37
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:18,990
Have you forgotten that the whole palace is 
not fond of having a half brother of the king around?

38
00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:21,700
Don't do anything to give them a reason to make it an issue.

39
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:27,550
It's my rightful duty to see you twice a day.

40
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:30,580
You still don't call me "mother".

41
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:37,220
It seem like you are spying on me. 
You are making me very uncomfortable.

42
00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:39,300
What do you mean by spying?

43
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:48,280
You still don't have a heir and have not gotten a concubine 
either.  Others are saying I am making you this way.

44
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:55,510
I'm just sorry for the one who has already passed.  
There isn't any other reason.

45
00:05:55,710 --> 00:06:02,580
Although I am your new mother, 
you must understand that I still care for you.

46
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:13,970
Then, please seek out for a new candidate for the queen's position.

47
00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:19,450
I will start seeking a new queen.

48
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,570
Who's out there?

49
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:32,090
My prince, please, come in.

50
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:40,050
Oh, my prince.

51
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:40,250
How...How can you...How can you do this to me?
Oh, my prince.

52
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:45,130
How...How can you...How can you do this to me?

53
00:06:45,690 --> 00:06:49,250
It's very late.  Let's go inside first.

54
00:06:51,890 --> 00:06:54,710
Didn't you promise me already?

55
00:06:54,710 --> 00:07:01,870
Yes, I have promised you. But I could not go against palace instruction...

56
00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:04,450
Why? Did she say that she doesn't want me?

57
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:07,680
Please let's step inside first...

58
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:08,270
Tell her to come out.

59
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:08,700
Very well.
Tell her to come out.

60
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:08,720
Very well.

61
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:12,990
I will tell her myself. Tell her to come out.

62
00:07:42,650 --> 00:07:46,970
Since you didn't go into the palace, we'll be running for the rest of our lives.

63
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:52,620
I will never go anywhere by myself alone.

64
00:07:53,570 --> 00:07:57,210
There isn't anything I can do for you.

65
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:08,040
All I want is to be together.

66
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:20,180
Kwon-yoo! Kwon-yoo!

67
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:21,630
Please take her outside.
Kwon-yoo! Kwon-yoo!

68
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:25,490
Kwon-yoo! Kwon-yoo!

69
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:29,750
No, don't. Don't!

70
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:35,560
Let go. Kwon-yoo!

71
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:36,190
No, Kwon-yoo! Don't!
Let go. Kwon-yoo!

72
00:09:36,190 --> 00:09:40,710
No, Kwon-yoo! Don't!

73
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:55,270
No, Father! I told him to flee with me. It wasn't Kwon-yoo's fault.

74
00:09:55,370 --> 00:10:01,780
If this is found out he, as well as all our family, won't survive.

75
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:03,430
Please, let Kwon-yoo live!

76
00:10:03,890 --> 00:10:05,640
That's already too late.

77
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:07,080
What are you doing?

78
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:07,420
Yes sir.

79
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:11,010
I'll go into the palace.

80
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:14,910
If Kwon-yoo dies, I will die as well!

81
00:10:20,590 --> 00:10:22,180
Let go of me!

82
00:10:25,090 --> 00:10:29,310
Where are you taking Hwa-yeon? Hwa-yeon! Hwa-yeon!

83
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:35,160
Let go! Let go!

84
00:11:06,850 --> 00:11:08,380
I'll do it myself.

85
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:13,080
Even the bathing has proper rules and order.

86
00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:17,280
Do you mean, I don't have freedom over my own body?

87
00:11:23,010 --> 00:11:23,110
*** 5 years later ***

88
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:26,760
Your Majesty, Seong-won prince is here to see you.
*** 5 years later ***

89
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:27,260
Your Majesty, Seong-won prince is here to see you.

90
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:33,940
I haven't seen you for a while.  Where have you been, my brother?

91
00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:38,190
I've been wondering without staying in the same place.

92
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:50,010
Your Majesty, I'm afraid you look so ill.

93
00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:57,570
I haven't been well for a few days,  
but seeing you is making me feel much better.

94
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:03,860
How is the world outside of the palace?

95
00:12:05,790 --> 00:12:11,390
The weather is cold enough to have fruits on the 
trees and the colors of autumn are beautiful to see.

96
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:18,670
Your people are taking chrysanthemum flowers to make wine...

97
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:38,900
This is happening often, recently.

98
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:44,400
The royal doctors don't know the reason either.  It's just very frustrating.

99
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:51,510
He will get better soon.  Your highness need not worry so much.

100
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:57,160
You left so sudden, I was worried.

101
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:02,540
You worried about me?

102
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:11,080
My thoughtlessness made you both worry.

103
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,060
I'm just glad you come back healthy.

104
00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:21,820
I came as soon as I heard of His Majesty's illness.  
I'll be leaving as soon as he gets better.

105
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:30,570
It might be a burden to you and the young prince if I stay in the palace.

106
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:35,140
What burden? His Majesty is very happy to see you.

107
00:13:49,610 --> 00:13:53,560
I took away too much time as you already have a weary heart.

108
00:14:16,970 --> 00:14:24,480
His body was blue all over...this mean that 
there must be someone who's harming him purposely.

109
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,720
What do you mean by harming His Majesty?  Be careful what you say.

110
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:27,260
Please calm down and let's hear what the doctor has to say.
What do you mean by harming His Majesty?  Be careful what you say.

111
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:34,330
Please calm down and let's hear what the doctor has to say.

112
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:41,710
He's been weak from the tumor and is not eating enough...

113
00:14:41,710 --> 00:14:42,300
Are you sure that there isn't something wrong with his food?
He's been weak from the tumor and is not eating enough...

114
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:43,360
Are you sure that there isn't something wrong with his food?

115
00:14:43,490 --> 00:14:49,150
If there is a problem with the food, we need 
to investigate the royal chef and find out the truth.

116
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:49,970
That's right. We should...

117
00:14:49,970 --> 00:14:57,030
You are wrong.  It won't be too late to investigate 
after His Majesty gains back some energy.

118
00:14:57,030 --> 00:15:02,700
What are you talking about? We need to find out 
the truth in order to prescribe the right treatment to him.

119
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:14,460
Your Highness, he is extremely ill so please come back at a later time.

120
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:19,040
What do you mean? I'm his mother.  Move a side.

121
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:20,460
Your Highness!

122
00:15:21,090 --> 00:15:24,610
What's your intention for preventing me from seeing him?

123
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:29,430
I need to see his condition with my own eyes.

124
00:15:30,170 --> 00:15:35,900
Please tell the Queen Mother that His Majesty 
is not in a condition to see her right now.

125
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:41,010
Are you saying that I am harming him now?

126
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:45,940
Go bring the instruments now, hurry.

127
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:47,310
Yes, sir.

128
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:05,190
Is he not being able to breath?

129
00:16:05,410 --> 00:16:07,830
Don't just look, please try something.

130
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:29,580
This is a lethal location.

131
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:53,780
Your Majesty, please let us know of your successor. Please make your decision.

132
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:27,390
Your Majesty!

133
00:17:27,550 --> 00:17:55,210
Your Majesty ... Your Majesty ... Your Majesty ...

134
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:18,020
The king has passed. The king has passed. The king has passed.

135
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:21,200
You've done well.  You've been most helpful.

136
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:31,130
But the queen and the young prince survive, as well as the
queen's father who has many follower and is from a warrior clan...

137
00:18:41,690 --> 00:18:45,340
Don't you think I can take care of a woman and a child?

138
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:54,350
With her father and left minister (war minister) gone, she won't have a chance.

139
00:19:00,050 --> 00:19:05,520
Your Highness, we need to do something before the Queen Mother does something.

140
00:19:06,590 --> 00:19:08,960
The Queen Mother has the right to choose the successor.

141
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:12,280
Do you think they're that easy to persuade?

142
00:19:13,910 --> 00:19:21,390
Your Highness, if we retreat from here you and the young prince's life could be in danger.

143
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:31,660
Also, this is the chef's record.  There were no records for the day His Majesty became ill.

144
00:19:32,930 --> 00:19:33,740
You mean ..?

145
00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:37,660
That's right. Even the person who writes the record is missing as well.

146
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:43,680
There hasn't been enough time for them to take the recorder 
out of the palace.  That means, she is hidden somewhere inside of palace.

147
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:45,950
Inside of palace?

148
00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:53,110
Yes, Your Highness. We need to find the recorder and prove the murder.

149
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:58,490
The left minister and the others are planning to find the truth.  
All we need is to find the proof to assist them.

150
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:03,110
Who are you fellows? How dare you come...

151
00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:03,950
They all committed a sin of treason.  Arrest all of them.
Who are you fellows? How dare you come...

152
00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:07,350
They all committed a sin of treason.  Arrest all of them.

153
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:08,080
Yes sir.

154
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:15,400
Treason?  Yoon-jungho, you bastard!  Aren't you afraid of the heavens?

155
00:20:16,430 --> 00:20:19,140
Now that heaven has changed.

156
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:21,820
Boo-won Goon (the queen's father's title) come out!  You are under arrest.

157
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:23,260
What's the matter?

158
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:27,040
He has committed a sin of treason.  It's an order from the Queen Mother.

159
00:20:28,190 --> 00:20:34,060
How dare you make a loud noise here?  Go away!

160
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:35,700
Over there.  Catch him.

161
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:47,260
Take him away.

162
00:20:55,980 --> 00:21:08,050
This red color is made by dipping the cloth in a mixture of flower petals.  
It takes hundreds of dippings to make such a vibrant red.

163
00:21:09,050 --> 00:21:16,440
This red is the color that melds all the other 
colors, which signifies the color of a King.

164
00:21:20,190 --> 00:21:23,000
Your Majesty.  Your Majesty.

165
00:21:42,010 --> 00:21:46,020
Our duty is not to be part of politics.

166
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:52,570
We are in charge of His Majesty's wellbeing as well 
as maintaining the palace traditions and rules.

167
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:57,680
We are the hidden hands that allow the palace to function smoothly.

168
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:09,440
Everything we do is for His Majesty and the palace. 
All of you need to remember and remind yourselves of this.

169
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:10,920
Yes sir.

170
00:22:10,970 --> 00:22:18,380
Since the King is new on the throne, all eunuchs 
are to be on standby without any shift changes.

171
00:22:18,650 --> 00:22:23,230
If you stay here His Majesty will be in danger.  Don't move a muscle.

172
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:26,020
I said, don't move!

173
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:27,210
Who is that person?

174
00:22:27,210 --> 00:22:29,450
He came with a recommendation from Yoon-jungho Minister.

175
00:22:29,450 --> 00:22:31,450
Yoon-jungho Minister ... hmm.

176
00:22:32,330 --> 00:22:34,290
He is the future of the palace inner power.

177
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:35,260
What do you mean?

178
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:38,210
Since you became the Head of Eunuchs, you have become sneaky.

179
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:44,260
As for you...you may be a rat sitting on top of rice pot 
but you never know when your luck will run out.

180
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:50,490
If you want to stay there for long time, you need 
to learn to tame young ones like him.

181
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:54,980
Worrying about your food bowl, you must be getting old as well.

182
00:22:55,050 --> 00:22:56,820
What would be more important than one's food bowl?

183
00:22:57,670 --> 00:23:00,270
You know, I almost got beheaded this time.

184
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:06,480
I trust you, so please take care of me in the future as well ... hmm?

185
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:33,600
Your Majesty, please lay to the left of the queen.

186
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:44,880
Your Majesty, raise your left side 
so that your heart will be higher.

187
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:54,880
First, kiss the lower lip and suckle it.  
Then you must swallow her saliva.

188
00:23:57,670 --> 00:24:10,490
Place your hand on her lower stomach, then start caressing her.  
Continue until her breast enlarges...

189
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:15,980
Then cover her breast with one hand; cover it completely.

190
00:24:17,310 --> 00:24:22,780
Your Majesty, you may start your movement.

191
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:30,680
The Queen must embrace His Majesty's waist, 
then accept his penetration.

192
00:24:32,190 --> 00:24:37,660
Your Majesty, I am ready, so go ahead.

193
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:56,060
You may feel the pleasure building.

194
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:17,190
Next, position yourself behind her.

195
00:25:45,450 --> 00:25:45,640
It's not the time yet.

196
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:47,750
(Queen Mother) It's not time yet.
It's not the time yet.

197
00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:47,800
It's not the time yet.

198
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:47,810
You can get a son only by finish together.
It's not the time yet.

199
00:25:47,810 --> 00:25:48,050
You can get a son only by finish together.

200
00:25:48,050 --> 00:25:52,330
(Queen Mother) You can get a son only by finish together.
You can get a son only by finish together.

201
00:25:52,330 --> 00:25:52,410
You can get a son only by finish together.

202
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:37,820
It is time to head to the bed chamber, now.

203
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:46,110
You Majesty, if the Queen Mother finds out about this ...

204
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:53,040
What has happened?

205
00:26:53,270 --> 00:26:56,840
I couldn't even ask because of the leery mood in the royal kitchen.

206
00:26:57,220 --> 00:27:00,300
I don't know why but every one's avoiding me.

207
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:08,250
No matter what, we need to find the head chef.

208
00:27:14,810 --> 00:27:15,500
Your Highness.

209
00:27:16,590 --> 00:27:17,650
Do you know something?

210
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:19,620
Tell me.

211
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:24,590
It's just ... if she isn't dead...

212
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:31,620
I once heard when eunuchs were talking of a place ...

213
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:41,620
From the basement corridor of the main building, past the 
workers area, there is a passage to a lower floor entrance

214
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:49,460
The place has no daylight and dust snows down all day ...

215
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:58,070
Oh, and nobody is suppose to know of it or find out but the Queen Mother's army.

216
00:27:58,070 --> 00:27:59,200
You bitch.

217
00:28:00,130 --> 00:28:09,590
As you are a concubine to the past king, why aren't you paying respect to me?

218
00:28:10,890 --> 00:28:14,000
When did I order you to get the food ready?

219
00:28:16,490 --> 00:28:19,850
His Majesty will be coming by soon.

220
00:28:23,950 --> 00:28:26,140
How dare you starve me this way?

221
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:31,070
Your Highness, why are you out of the eunuch's quarter?

222
00:28:31,610 --> 00:28:35,000
Please put some makeup on and change your cloth as well. Ok?

223
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:43,420
Very well.

224
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:06,960
Your Highness!

225
00:29:08,810 --> 00:29:14,280
Your Highness ... Your Highness. Please take me out of here.

226
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:17,730
All I have done is what was asked of me.

227
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:18,810
Please, calm down.

228
00:29:21,430 --> 00:29:23,770
Calm yourself and take a look at this.

229
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,650
Is this what you have written?

230
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:32,520
Yes, Your Highness.

231
00:29:35,170 --> 00:29:36,030
But?

232
00:29:36,030 --> 00:29:40,340
Can you remember what His Majesty ate that day?

233
00:29:41,670 --> 00:29:45,920
On this day, His Majesty ate 
lunch at the Queen Mother's quarters.

234
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:49,040
At the Queen Mother's quarters ...

235
00:29:52,810 --> 00:29:58,060
The Queen Mother called suddenly, he told me not to prepare a meal.

236
00:30:00,750 --> 00:30:04,300
Why, does it not look appetizing?

237
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:09,340
I just feel a little bit of indigestion.

238
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:13,290
Why, do you think I would put poison in the food?

239
00:30:14,950 --> 00:30:15,810
Your Highness!

240
00:30:15,810 --> 00:30:21,360
People are saying that I am making you weak by using poison.

241
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:28,780
And then, His Majesty had diarrhea all night long.

242
00:30:42,710 --> 00:30:46,750
How dare you two break the rules of the palace?

243
00:30:48,210 --> 00:30:51,710
I will remind you of the consequence of undermining the rules.

244
00:30:59,590 --> 00:31:11,380
For him, cut off the rest of his penis.  For her, remove her uterus and 
sew her vagina to demonstrate the importance of palace rules.

245
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:25,680
Look here, your hands are so beautiful.

246
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:29,340
I know that as well.

247
00:31:44,710 --> 00:31:45,920
Your Majesty.

248
00:31:46,730 --> 00:31:47,980
Who are you?

249
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:53,050
Please kill me! ***meaning an apology**

250
00:31:53,050 --> 00:31:55,080
I've ask you who you are?

251
00:31:57,170 --> 00:31:58,960
I've committed a sin that's worth dying for. ***meaning an apology**

252
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:02,250
She is a servant girl who came with the Queen.

253
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:12,250
Please kill me.  I've committed a sin that's worth dying for.

254
00:32:42,350 --> 00:32:45,120
Your Majesty.  Why have you come to this unworthy place?

255
00:32:47,180 --> 00:32:51,460
Because I've never came by after you move to these quarters.

256
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:58,240
Such a late night, where did you go without a servant?

257
00:32:58,590 --> 00:33:03,830
My father is imprisoned as a traitor, how can a child sit and idle?

258
00:33:04,950 --> 00:33:09,650
I'm so sorry. I've been so busy with the funeral....

259
00:33:12,070 --> 00:33:19,070
I know you've had hardship.  Don't worry about your father.  
I will take care of it.

260
00:33:20,190 --> 00:33:23,460
No. I can't be a burden to Your Majesty.

261
00:33:24,810 --> 00:33:30,510
Just having survived, I am more than grateful.

262
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:40,910
How uncomfortable are you, using a 
building that hasn't been use in long time?

263
00:33:42,260 --> 00:33:43,780
Is there anyone outside?

264
00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:52,530
Call the building master and have him make alterations 
to the quarters to match her status.

265
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:57,960
The Queen Mother ordered the current condition of Her Highness's quarters.

266
00:33:58,590 --> 00:34:01,550
What? The Queen mother's made this decision?

267
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:08,990
How can the Queen Mother's decisions be taken over my orders?

268
00:34:17,050 --> 00:34:19,180
Your Highness, look at these.

269
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:25,830
The items sent by His Majesty are wonderful.

270
00:34:25,990 --> 00:34:27,080
This way.

271
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:38,250
The Nak-Dong River's repair work has polluted the water condition. 
Farmers are having a hard time farming in the area.

272
00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:48,360
Also, as a result of the monsoon rain 325 houses were damaged 
and more than 200 people are missing or dead.

273
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:59,610
Take emergency food from 3 states and have the Horse Minister 
and Water Minister take military personnel to help those in need.

274
00:34:59,770 --> 00:35:05,600
The next issue is, to celebrate the new Kingship, a 
list of people who will be release from the prison ...

275
00:35:07,820 --> 00:35:13,980
280 people from the capital region who 
have not committed the murder or treason,

276
00:35:14,270 --> 00:35:15,760
and 137 people from Kung-Gi state.

277
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:17,590
Do you even see me?

278
00:35:18,150 --> 00:35:20,920
Why don't you have anything for me?

279
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:26,080
That's because while Your Majesty gains experience, 
the Queen Mother will ...

280
00:35:26,130 --> 00:35:30,570
You think just sitting here will make me gain experience?

281
00:35:32,250 --> 00:35:36,130
From now on, take measure to include His Majesty 
in the decision making process.

282
00:35:37,410 --> 00:35:38,390
Please, continue.

283
00:35:39,140 --> 00:35:41,130
Is the Boo-won (queen's father) name included in the list?

284
00:35:57,860 --> 00:35:59,570
Are you out of your mind?

285
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:04,960
For who?  
Don't you know for whose benefit I'm getting rid of them?

286
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:09,090
The Boo-won (queen's father) has a lot of followers.

287
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:13,130
As there are a lot of misfortunes lately, 
I wouldn't want to loose the trust of the people ...

288
00:36:13,210 --> 00:36:17,010
When you went to see the Queen, 
did she ask you to have her father release?

289
00:36:18,770 --> 00:36:20,210
Did you spy on me?

290
00:36:22,250 --> 00:36:25,900
Although you have the temporary power 
to the throne, I am this nation's King.

291
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:26,990
You're not there yet.

292
00:36:28,290 --> 00:36:32,790
Having spoken with personal feelings in cabinet meeting ... 
do you really think you are ready?

293
00:36:35,930 --> 00:36:37,950
Have you forgotten how we got this far?

294
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:44,170
If we don't cut the new leaf, we can get hurt later.

295
00:36:47,660 --> 00:36:50,820
Your palace had a fire and we both almost died.

296
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:54,280
Your mother has never forgotten that incident.

297
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:58,670
Please ... Please don't repeat that incident again.

298
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:08,670
Although all of the women in the palace are yours to have, 
don't you know there is one woman you can't touch?

299
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:16,010
Gather all the eunuchs who helped 
His Majesty go to the Queen's place.

300
00:37:16,090 --> 00:37:20,530
What did I do wrong? 
I did everything Mother has asked me to do.

301
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:23,030
I took her as sister-in-law, as you asked.

302
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:25,430
Became a King as you asked.

303
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:28,320
What else do you want me to do?

304
00:37:51,310 --> 00:37:57,580
If I can't keep the bees from the flower, 
I have to remove the flower to solve a problem.

305
00:38:05,750 --> 00:38:07,080
Bring me something to drink.

306
00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:45,620
Let go of me. Let go of me.

307
00:38:47,140 --> 00:38:52,430
I took you in like my own son and kept you 
close, how dare you take my daughter?

308
00:38:52,430 --> 00:38:54,690
Hwa-yeon ... Hwa-yeon!

309
00:38:55,250 --> 00:39:00,780
Remember that I let you live.  
Don't you ever show your face in front of me.

310
00:39:00,860 --> 00:39:05,220
You there, make sure he can never act as a man again.

311
00:39:33,390 --> 00:39:37,890
Kwon-yoo!  How can you be here?

312
00:39:45,810 --> 00:39:47,810
I thought you were dead.

313
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:54,990
No, I prayed every moment that you are still alive.

314
00:39:56,110 --> 00:40:03,950
Kwon-yoo, I'm just grateful that you are alive.

315
00:40:06,110 --> 00:40:10,120
Kwon-yoo died then.

316
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:15,310
Kwon-yoo, what are you talking about?  Please help me.

317
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:19,460
I don't understand what's going on in the palace.

318
00:40:21,220 --> 00:40:24,040
I've found the proof that the King was murdered.

319
00:40:25,390 --> 00:40:27,120
You must go back.

320
00:40:28,930 --> 00:40:33,850
Don't you know that I am Yoon-jungho Minister's man?

321
00:40:35,820 --> 00:40:38,290
What do you mean by that?

322
00:40:44,650 --> 00:40:51,720
You are my only ally in the palace. Kwon-yoo ...

323
00:40:53,350 --> 00:40:54,780
How can you?

324
00:40:58,770 --> 00:41:03,850
What can I do at this point?

325
00:41:06,060 --> 00:41:10,770
You've gained that position (of Queen).  
What more do you want?

326
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:24,490
If you want to live, you should flee by yourself ... 
Just yourself, like last time.

327
00:41:27,260 --> 00:41:28,800
Just like last time.

328
00:41:31,410 --> 00:41:33,250
Flee by yourself.

329
00:41:38,060 --> 00:41:39,870
No one's allowed.

330
00:41:40,290 --> 00:41:44,920
Although that's the situation, Your Highness is here.

331
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:47,080
Let her see his face, at least.

332
00:41:47,210 --> 00:41:49,120
If something goes wrong, my neck will be gone.

333
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:50,400
I'm so sorry.

334
00:41:54,050 --> 00:41:58,670
My father is very old,  can you at least give him this?

335
00:41:59,580 --> 00:42:00,880
It's just a porridge.

336
00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:30,300
Your daughter has sent this.

337
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:48,630
How can you be here?

338
00:42:51,950 --> 00:42:54,450
You have done something very dangerous.

339
00:42:56,370 --> 00:43:00,620
She has done nothing wrong.

340
00:43:04,110 --> 00:43:10,810
I have discovered the truth about that day. 
If you tell me who to share the truth ...

341
00:43:12,110 --> 00:43:18,020
Listen!  I'm dying because of my sin, but she ...

342
00:43:22,190 --> 00:43:27,060
It would have been better if you'd killed me back then.

343
00:43:33,550 --> 00:43:39,110
Listen. Listen. Listen!

344
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:46,960
Is Hwa-yeon Queen's palace alright?

345
00:43:48,530 --> 00:43:51,820
Yes, I heard that she is fine.

346
00:43:53,710 --> 00:43:58,740
Stop by and find out if she needs anything.

347
00:44:00,810 --> 00:44:01,480
Yes sir.

348
00:44:02,780 --> 00:44:04,110
What's going on?

349
00:44:04,460 --> 00:44:08,450
Because of the sore, Your Majesty should not be 
eating dried persimmon in fruit punch.

350
00:44:09,670 --> 00:44:11,450
What is your name?

351
00:44:11,890 --> 00:44:13,340
It's Chun-young, Your Majesty.

352
00:44:13,450 --> 00:44:15,630
How did you know that I have a sore?

353
00:44:16,110 --> 00:44:20,440
I knew from the way you hesitated as you 
leaned your back, and by the color of your skin.

354
00:44:20,660 --> 00:44:24,570
Then how can one treat a sore?

355
00:44:24,730 --> 00:44:31,320
Hot blood chi circulates faster in heat and stops 
when it gets cold, a person with this type of chi gets such sores easily.

356
00:44:31,380 --> 00:44:35,100
Therefore, you must stay away from extreme heat or cold, Your Majesty.

357
00:44:35,180 --> 00:44:39,090
You look familiar, have you seen me before?

358
00:44:40,050 --> 00:44:41,300
I couldn't have.

359
00:44:41,300 --> 00:44:41,320
How can such a lowly one ever have seen Your Majesty before?
I couldn't have.

360
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:44,360
How can such a lowly one ever have seen Your Majesty before?

361
00:44:45,690 --> 00:44:50,770
Since I like this person, I will promote him to be near me.

362
00:44:51,780 --> 00:44:57,870
Your Majesty!  To be close to you a eunuch must 
work for at least 16 years to get the opportunity.

363
00:44:58,520 --> 00:45:04,920
This eunuch alone has worked over 20 years to get that opportunity. How can you 
give such an opportunity to a eunuch who just became a main building eunuch.

364
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:05,610
What?

365
00:45:06,490 --> 00:45:09,760
Don't I have power over a single eunuch?

366
00:45:10,340 --> 00:45:14,760
Why? Are you saying as Head Eunuch, 
you will only listen to the Queen Mother?

367
00:45:15,690 --> 00:45:17,230
I will do as you asked, Your Majesty.

368
00:45:33,940 --> 00:45:36,570
Your Highness, what are you doing here at this late hour?

369
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:40,080
Is this the reason?

370
00:45:40,350 --> 00:45:41,540
Kwon-yoo.

371
00:45:42,180 --> 00:45:47,950
All of them will be killed in the morning anyway. 
Why are you trying so hard?

372
00:45:49,900 --> 00:45:53,810
Because of Your Hhighness, the head chef died needlessly early.

373
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:02,000
Your Highness, what is going on?

374
00:46:02,580 --> 00:46:09,550
Because the young prince and I didn't die with the past king, 
we will be witnessing the death of my father.

375
00:46:09,710 --> 00:46:13,510
Kill us both first, instead.

376
00:46:13,810 --> 00:46:18,540
Although he has committed the sin of a traitor, killing him is too harsh a sentence.

377
00:46:18,940 --> 00:46:20,830
Please take back the order.

378
00:46:22,110 --> 00:46:24,980
It's already been decided.

379
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:31,890
Please let Boo-won live. I will do anything you want.

380
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:35,960
If you ask me not to see the Queen again, I will not...

381
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:43,650
It is the will of the other ministers to set an example 
for the future. Please don't mention this issue again.

382
00:46:48,940 --> 00:46:50,380
Who do you mean?

383
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:56,020
You mean those from your family side?

384
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:08,280
Is my sister-in-law hurting because my own brother didn't get rid of us?

385
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:10,120
You must speak carefully.

386
00:47:10,120 --> 00:47:14,690
Am I really King of this nation?

387
00:47:17,480 --> 00:47:22,350
This matter will not be done the way you want.

388
00:47:23,260 --> 00:47:24,290
Your Majesty.

389
00:47:24,370 --> 00:47:26,080
Is the Head Eunuch here?

390
00:47:26,080 --> 00:47:27,460
Yes, Your Majesty.

391
00:47:28,520 --> 00:47:31,020
You must hurry and stop the execution.

392
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:37,220
Your Majesty, you should not go against the Queen Mother's will ...

393
00:47:44,510 --> 00:47:45,650
Then you shall go.

394
00:47:48,900 --> 00:47:52,590
Do not try to decide.  It is not our right.

395
00:48:08,180 --> 00:48:11,350
Prisoner Shin, take this order paper.

396
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:19,730
Prisoner Shin and all your gang have endanger the kingdom through treason.

397
00:48:20,510 --> 00:48:25,600
In accordance to the law, 3 families from the clan 
of each traitorous member will be killed ...

398
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:26,520
How dare you?
In accordance to the law, 3 families from the clan 
of each traitorous member will be killed ...

399
00:48:26,520 --> 00:48:27,860
How dare you?

400
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:34,620
How dare you talk of the nation as you murder the king?

401
00:48:35,420 --> 00:48:36,830
Carry out the sentence.

402
00:49:04,280 --> 00:49:08,350
Step aside.  I've told you I have something to tell Her Highness.

403
00:49:08,350 --> 00:49:09,730
Your Majesty.

404
00:49:10,450 --> 00:49:13,670
Your Majesty, Please calm yourself.

405
00:49:57,870 --> 00:50:00,930
Your Majesty should go back now.

406
00:50:13,430 --> 00:50:16,360
Check, this is a hard one to escape.

407
00:50:16,650 --> 00:50:21,470
Let's take a look. It's big problem. Let me take a move back.

408
00:50:21,630 --> 00:50:25,170
You always want a move back.  
You think I will give you a move back for nothing.

409
00:50:25,240 --> 00:50:28,780
All I have is a set of balls.  Do you want that?

410
00:50:29,230 --> 00:50:34,710
A set of balls.  That sounds good.  I always wanted them. 
You may take 10 moves back if you want.

411
00:50:37,670 --> 00:50:41,390
Did you piss on a frozen foot?  You look like you just stepped in shit.

412
00:50:41,790 --> 00:50:43,410
How is your Korean chess game?

413
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:47,030
I always win, but it never make me happy.

414
00:50:47,910 --> 00:50:50,430
Why? Is the palace being strange?

415
00:50:51,470 --> 00:51:00,060
As my life in a palace has been 30 years long, it's like looking inside of my hand. 
But I still don't know what is right and what is wrong.

416
00:51:00,780 --> 00:51:07,190
You're really...in the main room the mother-in-law is always right
 and in the kitchen the wife is always right.

417
00:51:09,480 --> 00:51:15,490
When I first came to the palace, I put 
my manhood in a pot with all common sense.

418
00:51:15,980 --> 00:51:21,350
In this place right or wrong don't matter. 
but power and powerless matter.

419
00:51:21,770 --> 00:51:24,930
Wait a second.  Did I just say this awesome phrase?

420
00:51:25,220 --> 00:51:26,470
Aren't I something?

421
00:51:26,710 --> 00:51:28,600
You are something.

422
00:51:30,780 --> 00:51:34,590
What would you have wanted to become 
if you hadn't become a eunuch?

423
00:51:35,930 --> 00:51:41,270
As for me, all I wanted was to meet a pretty girl 
and have babies. Just a happy family.

424
00:51:43,500 --> 00:51:48,870
Let's stop there.  How can I get outside of palace before I die?

425
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:58,820
You jerk, are you testing to see if your eyeballs will ever pop out?

426
00:51:59,030 --> 00:52:01,640
I really don't like that jerk.

427
00:52:07,010 --> 00:52:09,430
***  King piece hanging on the edge ***

428
00:52:09,750 --> 00:52:13,950
For whom do you think Left Minister and Boo-won were acting treasonous?

429
00:52:14,490 --> 00:52:19,650
You must remove the queen and the young prince from the palace.

430
00:52:19,780 --> 00:52:27,920
Queen Mother.  You must punish the late king's survivors 
so that there won't be any problem in the future.

431
00:52:29,250 --> 00:52:31,590
His Majesty must not be coming again today.

432
00:52:34,090 --> 00:52:38,580
Queen Mother, you must make a decision.

433
00:52:38,580 --> 00:52:41,700
Please make a decision.

434
00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:46,540
Don't keep telling me to make decision.  
Rather, you need to bring me a solution to persuade His Majesty.

435
00:52:49,300 --> 00:52:50,790
Leave now.

436
00:52:52,870 --> 00:52:59,680
Your Majesty, please get remove the queen and 
the young prince from the palace.

437
00:53:05,370 --> 00:53:06,720
Bring me Yoon Minister.

438
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:10,790
Why can you not look at me?

439
00:53:11,750 --> 00:53:19,310
I'm too embarrass to look at you because you are not dressed properly.

440
00:53:21,190 --> 00:53:22,680
Are you really embarrass?

441
00:53:23,460 --> 00:53:28,220
In my eyes, making your demands while showing 
your full intention is more embarrassing.

442
00:53:31,970 --> 00:53:33,460
I'm going to ask you one thing.

443
00:53:34,120 --> 00:53:37,150
As a great King, what is most important?

444
00:53:37,690 --> 00:53:41,600
To practice virtue with empathy.

445
00:53:41,600 --> 00:53:45,350
Then, what is the start of empathy?

446
00:53:47,370 --> 00:53:51,010
um...It's a quality of feeling the pain of those in trouble.

447
00:53:51,010 --> 00:53:54,920
So, having to rid of a woman who 
lost her father demonstrates empathy?

448
00:53:55,720 --> 00:53:58,030
Is that the quality of a great King?

449
00:53:58,030 --> 00:54:04,360
However, you must think of the good of the nation 
even if you must remove some of us.

450
00:54:04,390 --> 00:54:10,690
You old fart!  How long do you think you'll have 
access to the Queen Mother's quarters?

451
00:54:11,250 --> 00:54:15,910
If you don't take all your group and leave now, 
I will give you what you wish.

452
00:54:17,500 --> 00:54:19,290
Get out of here.

453
00:54:46,280 --> 00:54:50,110
*** Taking the decorations from the head band. ***

454
00:54:50,110 --> 00:54:52,530
His Majesty is entering.

455
00:54:55,460 --> 00:54:57,000
Stay here.

456
00:54:57,830 --> 00:55:01,230
I don't know what this is about but 
why don't you return when there is light outside.

457
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:03,950
I've heard that you are not well.

458
00:55:04,690 --> 00:55:09,030
How can I be fine with having my father's head hanging on a pole?

459
00:55:10,750 --> 00:55:12,960
Is that the reason you are avoiding me?

460
00:55:17,670 --> 00:55:21,770
Do you know how the government is doing now?

461
00:55:21,770 --> 00:55:23,810
Yes, I know it very well.

462
00:55:24,210 --> 00:55:30,280
How happy would those whose are trying to 
get rid of me to discover that you are here?

463
00:55:30,280 --> 00:55:36,400
So please don't seek me out again.

464
00:55:37,350 --> 00:55:39,240
How can you be so cruel?

465
00:55:40,490 --> 00:55:42,990
Why do you think I manage to holding on to this position?

466
00:55:42,990 --> 00:55:48,740
As I'm barely holding on, how can you make me so sad?

467
00:55:50,810 --> 00:55:52,410
Instead, be mad at me.

468
00:55:52,410 --> 00:55:57,970
Tell me that I'm a king who took away the young 
prince's position and killed your father.

469
00:55:58,710 --> 00:56:01,610
At least shout out that you hate me so.

470
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:12,780
What is your name?

471
00:56:13,450 --> 00:56:15,970
It's Guum-oak, Your Majesty.

472
00:56:16,910 --> 00:56:20,420
Why? Are you going to take her to bed?

473
00:56:24,010 --> 00:56:25,500
It's not that I can't do that.

474
00:56:31,030 --> 00:56:34,140
Your Highness, why are doing this to me?

475
00:56:34,140 --> 00:56:37,710
Please don't send me off.  I don't want to.

476
00:56:37,710 --> 00:56:38,640
What are you doing?

477
00:56:41,190 --> 00:56:44,830
Your Highness!  Your Highness!

478
00:56:44,830 --> 00:56:47,040
Your Highness!  Please!

479
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:50,390
Your Highness, I don't want to go!

480
00:56:54,120 --> 00:56:57,310
Are you happy that everything you wanted has come true?

481
00:56:58,740 --> 00:57:01,460
Are you happy that you finally took your revenge?

482
00:57:04,860 --> 00:57:10,260
I thought you came to the palace for me.

483
00:57:14,780 --> 00:57:20,420
Now ... now, what should I do?

484
00:57:21,750 --> 00:57:30,050
If you want to live, if you want to get out of palace, 
I will look for a way.

485
00:57:31,090 --> 00:57:34,790
Why? Am I next?

486
00:57:35,240 --> 00:57:37,840
Do you know where I just came back from?

487
00:57:38,540 --> 00:57:42,710
I just came back from seeing your father's head on a poll.

488
00:58:10,990 --> 00:58:13,060
Does she blame me a lot?

489
00:58:15,800 --> 00:58:24,820
She is just very heavy hearted ... 
not being able to eat much and ...

490
00:58:28,200 --> 00:58:29,870
Continue.

491
00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:34,070
How does Her Highness look when she goes to bed?

492
00:58:34,310 --> 00:58:35,460
What?

493
00:58:36,970 --> 00:58:49,660
Well ... that's ... she changes her clothes and takes her hair down.

494
00:58:52,910 --> 00:58:55,750
White ... white sleep wear ...

495
00:58:58,200 --> 00:59:00,430
Who takes off her clothes?

496
00:59:01,760 --> 00:59:03,310
I do.

497
00:59:04,660 --> 00:59:06,580
How do you take it off?

498
00:59:07,720 --> 00:59:09,240
It's ... it's just ...

499
00:59:10,300 --> 00:59:14,050
I untie the knot and ...

500
00:59:14,560 --> 00:59:16,420
Do you bathe her as well?

501
00:59:16,420 --> 00:59:18,390
Yes, Your Majesty.

502
00:59:18,390 --> 00:59:20,620
How do you bathe her?

503
00:59:20,940 --> 00:59:26,850
In a nice scented bath tub ... she soaks her body.

504
00:59:26,850 --> 00:59:28,920
Where do you clean her first?

505
00:59:30,840 --> 00:59:33,440
With a nice clean cloth, I clean her arms ...

506
00:59:33,740 --> 00:59:36,630
then I clean her chest and shoulders.

507
00:59:36,630 --> 00:59:38,950
Is she smooth?

508
00:59:39,110 --> 00:59:43,440
Her skin is very smooth.

509
00:59:43,470 --> 00:59:44,880
Continue.

510
00:59:45,010 --> 00:59:48,950
When she rises up, I clean her legs and in between ...

511
01:00:44,780 --> 01:00:46,560
Your majesty.

512
01:02:07,850 --> 01:02:09,950
This is the room you'll be using from now on.

513
01:02:11,230 --> 01:02:21,360
Although His Majesty has given you the right, you haven't got the title yet. 
So take care of your body and don't stroll outside.

514
01:02:21,600 --> 01:02:22,800
Yes, Your Highness.

515
01:02:27,100 --> 01:02:28,650
I understand.

516
01:02:31,630 --> 01:02:33,910
This child is going to take care of you.

517
01:02:34,580 --> 01:02:36,120
Now I'll take my leave.

518
01:02:39,370 --> 01:02:41,600
Is there anything you might need?

519
01:02:44,020 --> 01:02:46,760
No I'm fine.  You may leave now.

520
01:02:46,970 --> 01:02:49,710
Yes.

521
01:03:07,960 --> 01:03:09,690
Get out of here.

522
01:03:12,350 --> 01:03:13,920
Is there anyone there?

523
01:03:17,080 --> 01:03:22,620
Your Majesty, thank you so much.

524
01:03:26,370 --> 01:03:29,110
Thank you, Your Majesty.

525
01:04:36,530 --> 01:04:38,210
Hey, Guum-oak!

526
01:04:42,520 --> 01:04:44,780
Are you having fun, my prince?

527
01:05:04,890 --> 01:05:06,960
It's sure is a crazy world.

528
01:05:07,970 --> 01:05:13,450
A servant like me becomes a concubine, and superior like you became a eunuch.

529
01:05:13,480 --> 01:05:15,420
Isn't it such fun?

530
01:05:16,640 --> 01:05:18,750
His Majesty is here.

531
01:05:23,290 --> 01:05:25,320
He came on time.

532
01:05:26,490 --> 01:05:28,960
He asked not to let anyone in.

533
01:05:32,200 --> 01:05:34,840
I've heard you got a promotion.

534
01:05:36,620 --> 01:05:40,000
Couldn't you help get him to come to my quarters?

535
01:05:41,510 --> 01:05:44,250
Isn't knowing you from outside of the palace also a fate?

536
01:05:44,250 --> 01:05:47,790
I have forgotten all events from before I came to the palace.

537
01:05:49,630 --> 01:05:53,320
There isn't anything to remember, since you never helped me.

538
01:05:54,440 --> 01:06:01,860
You are above your place now. You must be careful 
with your tongue not to cause any misfortune.

539
01:06:06,680 --> 01:06:14,360
I upset your feelings, 
not knowing you are in a difficult situation because of me.

540
01:06:15,750 --> 01:06:24,470
No, not at all.  Actually, I haven't been 
feeling good regarding the Boo-won incident.

541
01:06:24,580 --> 01:06:32,560
I don't know why the Queen Mother 
is being so harsh on me and the young prince.

542
01:06:33,140 --> 01:06:35,030
Your Highness.

543
01:06:45,480 --> 01:06:49,500
I'm so sorry about Boo-won.

544
01:06:54,240 --> 01:06:56,840
How can I dare blame you?

545
01:06:58,200 --> 01:07:01,230
I must be lacking the qualities of a good king.

546
01:07:03,280 --> 01:07:06,340
What are you saying, Your Majesty?

547
01:07:07,450 --> 01:07:13,280
The late king always mentioned that only you know of how to rule.

548
01:07:15,810 --> 01:07:19,000
How can there be an authority over you?     
*** speaking of the Queen Mother ***

549
01:07:19,420 --> 01:07:24,110
I just feel pitiful and stifled.

550
01:07:26,450 --> 01:07:30,620
You need to make a decision to take away the Queen's title.

551
01:07:33,230 --> 01:07:38,440
There is no reason to take her title away.

552
01:07:38,890 --> 01:07:39,770
What?

553
01:07:39,770 --> 01:07:46,020
With both wings cut off, if she has an accident, 
who would care about the truth?

554
01:07:46,980 --> 01:07:49,160
You don't need to worry about her.

555
01:07:49,430 --> 01:07:52,940
She has survive 30 years in a turbulent palace.

556
01:07:53,840 --> 01:07:56,800
Do you know why she only has one ear?

557
01:07:58,740 --> 01:08:01,610
She heard something she shouldn't.

558
01:08:08,760 --> 01:08:10,840
She is a smart one.

559
01:08:11,180 --> 01:08:15,120
She knows the flow of events better then anyone.

560
01:08:17,990 --> 01:08:20,810
I heard that you went to Soo-yong Queen's quarter.

561
01:08:27,600 --> 01:08:31,370
Do you know anything about poison?

562
01:08:32,970 --> 01:08:37,120
I have a little experience from when I was younger.

563
01:08:57,410 --> 01:08:59,170
How can you carry such an object in the palace?

564
01:08:59,170 --> 01:09:00,740
That will be big trouble.

565
01:09:01,220 --> 01:09:05,740
But to the eyes of ignorant, it's just a stone.

566
01:09:10,420 --> 01:09:13,400
Do you know how to make poison using that?

567
01:09:14,380 --> 01:09:15,690
You need to burn it first.

568
01:09:15,690 --> 01:09:17,470
Prepare it and be ready.

569
01:09:18,720 --> 01:09:26,380
If that mother and a son don't leave the palace willingly, 
there is only one other way.

570
01:09:49,250 --> 01:09:51,620
I heard that there is a sale for His Majesty's sleeping quarter decision.

571
01:09:52,050 --> 01:09:56,830
Me?  How could I dare?

572
01:09:56,970 --> 01:10:01,140
Please bring His Majesty to my quarters on the 3rd of next month.

573
01:10:01,140 --> 01:10:03,860
I mustn't.

574
01:10:03,860 --> 01:10:04,180
Who knows?  If I get a prince, you might get a promotion.
I mustn't.

575
01:10:04,180 --> 01:10:07,900
Who knows?  If I get a prince, you might get a promotion.

576
01:10:18,860 --> 01:10:23,330
Even eating you, frog, isn't giving me energy...

577
01:10:23,330 --> 01:10:25,350
There ...

578
01:10:28,830 --> 01:10:32,580
Being in the pharmacy for 30 years, 
I know the need by hearing one's foot steps.

579
01:10:32,580 --> 01:10:35,700
Let's see if there is a place for a son.

580
01:10:35,880 --> 01:10:39,370
Please remove all personal feeling.

581
01:10:44,130 --> 01:10:46,920
Since there isn't a lot of chances, you must make sure of it.

582
01:10:46,920 --> 01:10:48,360
Okay, Okay.

583
01:10:50,780 --> 01:10:52,130
Your breasts aren't even.  Are they?

584
01:10:52,130 --> 01:10:53,540
No, they are.

585
01:10:53,540 --> 01:10:55,940
If so it requires us to use a different medicine.

586
01:10:55,940 --> 01:10:58,380
If they're uneven, you'll have a harder time conceiving a son.

587
01:10:59,210 --> 01:11:00,880
Your breasts aren't even, are they?

588
01:11:00,880 --> 01:11:02,750
They are even.

589
01:11:02,750 --> 01:11:05,460
There, there.  Let's take a look.

590
01:11:08,090 --> 01:11:10,890
I can't tell by just looking.  I must feel them.

591
01:11:11,310 --> 01:11:13,280
I told you they are even.

592
01:11:13,810 --> 01:11:15,940
You are right.  It's a relief.

593
01:11:16,920 --> 01:11:25,380
This one goes in ... is this one for a son? 
This one will change from a daughter to a son.

594
01:11:28,150 --> 01:11:31,020
Take it on the 14th day.

595
01:11:31,050 --> 01:11:32,860
On the 14th day, right?

596
01:11:37,460 --> 01:11:41,710
Wait a second.  This one's for a son.

597
01:11:41,900 --> 01:11:43,950
Oh well, she took the one for the daughter.

598
01:11:44,480 --> 01:11:46,980
People's mind are so cunning.

599
01:11:47,190 --> 01:11:51,550
I never thought I could be up, 
but once I got up I don't want to get back down.

600
01:11:52,170 --> 01:11:53,600
Isn't that right, Your Highness?

601
01:11:53,710 --> 01:11:57,910
Having His Majesty once made me wonder, 
maybe I can become a queen as well.

602
01:11:57,940 --> 01:11:59,640
Don't you know who you are in front of?

603
01:12:00,280 --> 01:12:01,980
You must speak careful.

604
01:12:02,780 --> 01:12:05,710
How dare you tell me what to do? Huh?

605
01:12:10,600 --> 01:12:14,720
Who do you think I will help if I have His Majesty's mind?

606
01:12:14,860 --> 01:12:17,510
Do you think I could hurt you?

607
01:12:21,240 --> 01:12:23,130
I know what you mean.

608
01:12:23,550 --> 01:12:26,290
Okay. What can I help you with?

609
01:12:26,290 --> 01:12:28,900
If I want to stand out, I must decorate myself a little.

610
01:12:30,470 --> 01:12:31,980
With some jewelry ...

611
01:12:32,440 --> 01:12:36,080
You probably know better than me, so help yourself.

612
01:12:51,080 --> 01:12:59,940
When you have a heir to the throne, I might 
build a small quarter far away to stay in.

613
01:12:59,940 --> 01:13:04,750
It's my sin that I haven't conceived an heir for you yet.

614
01:13:05,760 --> 01:13:13,900
Your Highness, His Majesty has a bad headache today.  
So, he won't be able to come here tonight.

615
01:13:16,860 --> 01:13:20,390
Did he not come knowing that it's a lucky day 
that comes around every 4 years?

616
01:13:20,390 --> 01:13:22,040
Yes, he did.

617
01:13:27,040 --> 01:13:30,790
Let's go.  I must go see him since he is ill.

618
01:13:33,320 --> 01:13:37,340
Have you learn how to become a good king?

619
01:13:39,410 --> 01:13:42,740
 It is okay to tell me.

620
01:13:43,690 --> 01:13:48,050
Yes, Your Majesty.  It's "myung", "chal", "tong".

621
01:13:49,650 --> 01:13:52,130
Then what is the meaning of "myung"?

622
01:13:52,150 --> 01:13:56,120
Myung is having clear sight and a good ear.

623
01:13:56,250 --> 01:14:07,310
With your eyes, you should see far with clarity. 
With your ear, you must hear the needs of your people.

624
01:14:07,310 --> 01:14:08,720
That's right.

625
01:14:08,960 --> 01:14:13,140
You did good. Here ...

626
01:14:14,390 --> 01:14:17,930
Your Majesty, the medicine is getting cold.

627
01:14:19,070 --> 01:14:23,810
I'm not a king. but a tool to produce an heir.

628
01:14:24,630 --> 01:14:27,210
That isn't true.

629
01:14:27,530 --> 01:14:31,230
How can having an heir to the throne be taken lightly?

630
01:14:31,230 --> 01:14:34,360
Shut up.  You drink it.

631
01:14:36,550 --> 01:14:39,980
It would've been better if you became a king instead.

632
01:14:39,980 --> 01:14:40,700
Your Majesty, the Queen Mother is entering.
It would've been better if you became a king instead.

633
01:14:40,700 --> 01:14:43,200
Your Majesty, the Queen Mother is entering.

634
01:15:05,090 --> 01:15:07,480
Do you know which occasion this is?

635
01:15:08,070 --> 01:15:12,850
I'm not just your son but the King of this nation.

636
01:15:14,240 --> 01:15:16,310
Do you think you are a King just because you are sitting on a throne?

637
01:15:16,310 --> 01:15:18,090
You don't join in on cabinet meetings.

638
01:15:18,090 --> 01:15:21,500
You haven't granted me any chance to accomplish anything.

639
01:15:21,710 --> 01:15:24,450
You keep all the power to make any decision.

640
01:15:24,450 --> 01:15:27,400
Now you're asking me to be a scarecrow/puppet.

641
01:15:29,160 --> 01:15:33,250
I would step down without a word after having an 
heir to the throne and things become stable.

642
01:15:33,250 --> 01:15:35,620
When would that be?

643
01:15:37,030 --> 01:15:38,310
What?

644
01:15:38,520 --> 01:15:41,900
Why didn't you just take the throne for yourself instead?

645
01:15:43,040 --> 01:15:46,630
I'm sick and tired of having to mate in front of you.

646
01:15:46,850 --> 01:15:51,020
I'm only expected to produce the seed.

647
01:15:51,740 --> 01:15:54,910
It doesn't have to be with the Queen.

648
01:15:55,810 --> 01:15:58,310
Since it's a luck day ...

649
01:15:58,680 --> 01:16:00,890
Let's give a concubine some chance as well.

650
01:16:01,400 --> 01:16:02,650
Who is it?

651
01:16:02,650 --> 01:16:05,250
It's Guum-oak.  
*** it really wasn't ***

652
01:16:05,250 --> 01:16:06,950
Let's go.

653
01:16:18,820 --> 01:16:21,130
How dare ...

654
01:16:23,530 --> 01:16:25,130
Your Majesty.

655
01:16:27,330 --> 01:16:29,670
Why do you have this on you?

656
01:16:30,260 --> 01:16:33,100
Your Majesty, that's because ...

657
01:16:33,550 --> 01:16:36,530
I just asked you why you have this on you.

658
01:16:36,930 --> 01:16:41,450
That ... that's because ... because ...

659
01:16:41,450 --> 01:16:43,710
Your Majesty.

660
01:16:44,830 --> 01:16:47,300
There is something I would like to tell you.

661
01:16:52,170 --> 01:16:56,380
Your Majesty should definitely know about this matter.

662
01:17:04,860 --> 01:17:07,470
Why is this in the hand of other person?

663
01:17:09,060 --> 01:17:12,230
Please do not get upset and sit first.

664
01:17:12,230 --> 01:17:14,750
Don't you know how I really feel?

665
01:17:16,400 --> 01:17:18,850
Do you hate me so much?

666
01:17:20,740 --> 01:17:26,750
I ... I'm not as good as that eunuch?

667
01:17:29,010 --> 01:17:30,980
Bring him in.

668
01:17:34,250 --> 01:17:36,730
I thought I recognized him.

669
01:17:36,940 --> 01:17:39,970
Isn't he the one who used to live in the same house?

670
01:17:40,320 --> 01:17:43,060
How can you disguise a man like him to bring him into the palace?

671
01:17:43,060 --> 01:17:44,730
You must speak carefully.

672
01:17:44,730 --> 01:17:46,250
Please explain yourself.

673
01:17:46,250 --> 01:17:48,880
Why is this person here in the palace?

674
01:17:48,880 --> 01:17:55,260
Although he was from the house I grew in, 
only after eunuch introduction did I recognize him.

675
01:17:55,260 --> 01:17:58,670
Are you asking me to believe you?

676
01:18:00,400 --> 01:18:04,250
I vividly remember his stare towards you.

677
01:18:04,870 --> 01:18:07,900
Your Highness and this jerk definitely ...

678
01:18:12,810 --> 01:18:16,080
Who's the father to your son - 
you weren't pregnant for the whole term?

679
01:18:17,020 --> 01:18:19,550
Is he really my brother's son?

680
01:18:20,850 --> 01:18:22,950
Take his clothes off him.

681
01:18:22,950 --> 01:18:25,880
I need to confirm that he is truly not a man.

682
01:18:25,880 --> 01:18:29,230
Your Majesty, do you need to go that far?

683
01:18:29,470 --> 01:18:30,990
Take his clothes off now!

684
01:18:31,560 --> 01:18:35,470
Your Majesty, why would you want to 
see a monstrous thing like that?

685
01:19:05,480 --> 01:19:08,600
Now please take your leave.

686
01:19:16,870 --> 01:19:20,380
Your Highness, don't you know?

687
01:19:21,420 --> 01:19:24,180
Do you think that I really don't know your heart?

688
01:19:28,410 --> 01:19:32,460
As the Queen Mother watches each and every move ...

689
01:19:34,400 --> 01:19:38,170
I don't care about the Queen Mother, or anything else.

690
01:19:39,560 --> 01:19:40,990
Please look at me.

691
01:19:40,990 --> 01:19:45,410
I'm so ashamed.  Why do you think that I continue?

692
01:19:48,520 --> 01:19:49,880
Your Majesty.

693
01:20:01,690 --> 01:20:03,120
Your Majesty.

694
01:20:09,910 --> 01:20:10,920
Your Majesty.

695
01:20:13,520 --> 01:20:14,830
Your Majesty.

696
01:20:22,620 --> 01:20:27,940
You may come back when you truly becomes a King.

697
01:20:36,160 --> 01:20:41,270
I'll become a King.  I will definitely become a King.

698
01:20:48,990 --> 01:20:52,400
What happened last night with 
His Majesty is against heavenly rules.

699
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:58,740
Others should not find out about this.

700
01:20:59,140 --> 01:21:00,760
Yes, Your Highness.

701
01:21:00,970 --> 01:21:10,380
You know the truth ... you know what 
I've done to give him the throne.

702
01:21:12,150 --> 01:21:13,850
Get rid of them.

703
01:21:35,010 --> 01:21:38,710
Why ... why didn't you tell me?   
*** familiar term speech ***

704
01:21:39,940 --> 01:21:44,380
What would change by telling you?  
*** familiar term speech ***

705
01:21:46,780 --> 01:21:51,090
If you had just told me what happened ... 
*** familiar term speech ***

706
01:22:02,800 --> 01:22:04,270
Let's leave. 
*** familiar term speech ***

707
01:22:05,900 --> 01:22:12,170
Leave?  We tried that once before. 
*** familiar term speech ***

708
01:22:19,780 --> 01:22:27,790
Instead of living this way, let's just leave everything and just take off. 
*** familiar term speech ***

709
01:22:28,890 --> 01:22:33,260
When we get out of palace, we'll all be murdered. 
*** familiar term speech ***

710
01:22:33,780 --> 01:22:35,530
I can't let harm come to the child. 
*** familiar term speech ***

711
01:22:35,760 --> 01:22:40,670
No matter what, he is the prince of the late king. 
*** familiar term speech ***

712
01:22:41,340 --> 01:22:43,000
You will die because of that one reason. 
*** familiar term speech ***

713
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:51,280
No ... No matter what, I will protect him myself. 
***  familiar term speech ***

714
01:23:00,750 --> 01:23:06,890
What ... what shall I do? 
*** familiar term speech ***

715
01:23:09,700 --> 01:23:14,670
What would you like me to do for you? 
*** familiar term speech ***

716
01:23:29,400 --> 01:23:34,750
Your Majesty, that is the 40th arrow already.  Your health ...

717
01:23:40,280 --> 01:23:42,350
You asked for me, Your Majesty.

718
01:23:50,420 --> 01:23:51,460
Take a shot.

719
01:23:51,880 --> 01:23:53,950
I want to see your skill.

720
01:23:54,180 --> 01:23:56,840
How could I dare to hold your bow?

721
01:23:56,840 --> 01:23:58,590
Give him an arrow.

722
01:24:09,480 --> 01:24:10,700
Kwon-yoo.

723
01:24:14,330 --> 01:24:17,260
What reason did you have to hide your 
identity and came into the palace?

724
01:24:18,100 --> 01:24:22,230
I've became a eunuch because it was only way 
a man without manhood can succeed.

725
01:24:24,700 --> 01:24:27,620
How dare a person like you had feelings toward a royal concubine?

726
01:24:28,400 --> 01:24:30,980
Feelings? No, there couldn't be such an emotion.

727
01:24:33,410 --> 01:24:40,980
I must go to the Queen's quarters.  As I made 
a big mistake yesterday, I must apologize.

728
01:24:42,120 --> 01:24:47,680
Instead ...The Queen Mother is still waiting for your morning visit ...

729
01:25:04,610 --> 01:25:07,340
He's still suspicious of the matter.

730
01:25:12,880 --> 01:25:15,050
You can't live this way forever.

731
01:25:27,520 --> 01:25:30,370
Your Majesty, you shouldn't be doing this.

732
01:25:33,820 --> 01:25:35,110
Your Majesty.

733
01:25:45,570 --> 01:25:47,220
Your Majesty, what are you doing?

734
01:26:04,390 --> 01:26:07,430
Kwon-yoo ... where is Kwon-yoo?

735
01:26:09,520 --> 01:26:10,910
Call for him.

736
01:27:20,770 --> 01:27:22,830
I will no longer take medicine like that.

737
01:27:22,840 --> 01:27:30,110
But Your Majesty, 
the Queen Mother checks on your medicine everyday ...

738
01:27:30,280 --> 01:27:32,180
Then you take it.

739
01:27:32,490 --> 01:27:41,860
What? For me, trying to suppress the male hormone, I don't even 
consume Kimchi with garlic.  How can I take this type of medicine?

740
01:27:42,530 --> 01:27:48,300
Oh ... does a man without manhood have a sex drive?

741
01:27:49,030 --> 01:27:56,710
I'm sorry to say, but having no ejaculation 
doesn't mean that there is no sex drive.

742
01:28:00,210 --> 01:28:03,380
Kwon-yoo ... you drink it.

743
01:28:06,200 --> 01:28:11,500
Why? You can't drink it?  Are you worry about having a sex drive?

744
01:28:12,840 --> 01:28:14,000
Drink it up.

745
01:28:42,010 --> 01:28:44,110
I can't let my child be in danger.

746
01:28:45,330 --> 01:28:49,090
No matter what, I will protect him.

747
01:29:05,810 --> 01:29:09,040
Since you don't even have the root of it, 
there is nothing to worry about.

748
01:29:17,150 --> 01:29:21,730
What is wrong? How can this be?

749
01:29:25,760 --> 01:29:30,550
Who is it? Who ordered this?

750
01:29:30,550 --> 01:29:32,600
Please calm down, Your Majesty.

751
01:29:32,600 --> 01:29:39,670
I don't know anything ... as on any other day, 
I got the ingredient and made the medicine myself ...

752
01:29:41,530 --> 01:29:43,080
Your Majesty.

753
01:29:47,700 --> 01:29:51,960
I will killed anyone who speaks of this news.

754
01:29:52,780 --> 01:29:59,160
Call in a doctor secretly.  Save this jerk.

755
01:29:59,450 --> 01:30:02,200
I have to hear something from him.

756
01:30:07,880 --> 01:30:10,080
Please spare my life, Your Majesty.

757
01:30:10,680 --> 01:30:13,750
I really don't know anything about this.

758
01:30:13,840 --> 01:30:15,150
Bring in the evidence.

759
01:30:16,250 --> 01:30:20,450
Do you know what this is?  This came out of your room.

760
01:30:21,580 --> 01:30:24,250
I really don't know anything.

761
01:30:28,850 --> 01:30:30,890
Did the Queen Mother ask you to get rid of me?

762
01:30:30,890 --> 01:30:33,120
That didn't happen, Your Majesty.

763
01:30:33,120 --> 01:30:33,440
Then who takes care of all the ingredients?
That didn't happen, Your Majesty.

764
01:30:33,440 --> 01:30:35,610
Then who takes care of all the ingredients?

765
01:30:36,120 --> 01:30:38,280
You shall not deny that knowledge.

766
01:30:39,330 --> 01:30:42,000
It's Yoon-jungho Minister.

767
01:30:51,370 --> 01:30:53,770
His Majesty ordered that no one be let in.

768
01:30:56,260 --> 01:31:00,070
Here.  Here.

769
01:31:00,440 --> 01:31:04,930
Here, come out of it.

770
01:31:06,520 --> 01:31:10,170
Water ... water.

771
01:31:12,480 --> 01:31:13,810
Here you go.

772
01:31:18,140 --> 01:31:20,030
M ... more.

773
01:31:29,710 --> 01:31:31,130
Are you okay now?

774
01:31:31,830 --> 01:31:34,720
I'm like a pumpkin leaf that got hammered by hail.

775
01:31:35,400 --> 01:31:37,910
I must look terrible.

776
01:31:39,080 --> 01:31:42,210
This is not too bad.

777
01:31:43,530 --> 01:31:47,370
He revealed the Yoon Minister's name.

778
01:31:47,830 --> 01:31:50,340
Soon there will be blood all over the palace.

779
01:31:50,650 --> 01:31:56,730
So, let me go first.

780
01:31:57,460 --> 01:32:01,430
What do you mean?

781
01:32:02,270 --> 01:32:06,940
You know better than anyone, what power does to people.

782
01:32:07,320 --> 01:32:13,020
His Majesty probably wants to use this 
latest event to solve his own agenda.

783
01:32:13,320 --> 01:32:22,850
They say even rolling on a field full of dog poop is 
better than dead. I don't want to live like this any longer.

784
01:32:28,450 --> 01:32:30,270
I can't do it.

785
01:32:31,210 --> 01:32:36,960
If the King want your name as well, what would you do?

786
01:32:43,160 --> 01:32:45,030
What are you doing?

787
01:32:46,610 --> 01:32:49,550
I will take you outside of the palace.

788
01:32:49,680 --> 01:32:54,020
It's no use.  I'm already too tired.

789
01:32:54,020 --> 01:32:56,500
I told you I will take care of everything.

790
01:33:04,160 --> 01:33:09,910
Hey ... Thanks for not making me so lonely.

791
01:33:10,710 --> 01:33:12,990
I'm sorry that I go first.

792
01:33:12,990 --> 01:33:15,160
Put that down.  Please put it down.

793
01:33:19,760 --> 01:33:22,800
Stay alive.

794
01:33:23,040 --> 01:33:25,860
Phil-il, you ...

795
01:33:32,480 --> 01:33:38,060
Please don't wonder around as you go off.

796
01:33:39,620 --> 01:33:47,580
Just head towards ... just head toward the light.

797
01:33:55,840 --> 01:34:00,250
I will bring the prince back safely.

798
01:34:01,710 --> 01:34:05,720
I will see you soon so - don't worry.

799
01:34:10,670 --> 01:34:14,180
Mother, I don't want to leave.

800
01:34:14,180 --> 01:34:22,320
Mother. Mother.

801
01:34:22,840 --> 01:34:25,020
Are you sure you are not telling a lie?

802
01:34:25,020 --> 01:34:28,290
How dare I tell a lie to you, Your Highness.

803
01:34:30,110 --> 01:34:34,070
She passed the eunuch's son off as heir to the king.

804
01:34:35,670 --> 01:34:38,640
She got the queen's position with a lie?

805
01:34:42,100 --> 01:34:43,800
How dare she ...

806
01:34:45,810 --> 01:34:47,620
Is there someone out there?

807
01:34:50,610 --> 01:34:51,990
Yes, Your Highness.

808
01:34:52,410 --> 01:34:53,700
Take her to the secret palace.

809
01:35:02,090 --> 01:35:04,150
M ... me?

810
01:35:07,600 --> 01:35:14,390
Your Highness. I would rather become a servant again.

811
01:35:14,580 --> 01:35:16,550
Just don't send me to the secret palace.

812
01:35:17,480 --> 01:35:19,960
Instead of going to the secret palace, I would rather die!

813
01:35:21,520 --> 01:35:22,970
Kill her.

814
01:35:24,070 --> 01:35:27,840
Your ... Your highness!  No, Your Highness ... Your Highness!

815
01:35:27,840 --> 01:35:31,970
Your Highness!  Let go! Let go! Your Highness.

816
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:35,140
Why are you doing this to me? Your Highness!

817
01:35:35,140 --> 01:35:51,670
Your Highness, please save me. Your Highness!  
Let go! Please save me! I don't want to die!

818
01:35:51,670 --> 01:35:59,300
I'm sorry!

819
01:35:59,300 --> 01:36:04,200
We have an order to bring you from the Queen Mother herself.

820
01:36:08,110 --> 01:36:11,170
Yoon-jungho Minister come out and receive the order of the King.

821
01:36:19,080 --> 01:36:22,770
You jerk. How dare you come into this quarter?

822
01:36:23,070 --> 01:36:24,570
What are you doing?

823
01:36:25,130 --> 01:36:27,910
It's your King's order to arrest Yoon-jungho minister as a traitor.

824
01:36:28,610 --> 01:36:33,310
What treason? Get out of here.

825
01:36:33,470 --> 01:36:37,540
I'm sorry Your Highness.  
The King has ordered his imprisonment right away.

826
01:36:38,730 --> 01:36:40,350
The King's order?

827
01:36:44,630 --> 01:36:46,890
Who do you think gave you that position?

828
01:36:48,500 --> 01:36:49,990
How dare you aim a sword towards me?

829
01:36:52,010 --> 01:36:55,990
You dare to aim a sword toward me.

830
01:37:00,400 --> 01:37:04,870
I'll go see His Majesty, 
so go take care of the bitch in the secret palace.

831
01:37:11,380 --> 01:37:15,080
Your Majesty, the head eunuch has arrived.

832
01:37:40,320 --> 01:37:42,050
Your majesty.

833
01:37:44,330 --> 01:37:46,520
Where are you, Your Majesty?

834
01:37:46,670 --> 01:37:48,790
I came knowing that you're here.

835
01:37:49,680 --> 01:37:51,780
Come out here, Your Majesty.

836
01:37:52,650 --> 01:38:00,690
Since I got up here and look down, 
I understand why you like it up here.

837
01:38:00,700 --> 01:38:02,960
What are you doing there?

838
01:38:04,430 --> 01:38:07,760
For what reason did you have 
Yoon-jungho Minister put in prison?

839
01:38:11,190 --> 01:38:13,780
I heard that you pushed back the soldiers I sent.

840
01:38:14,350 --> 01:38:17,670
How dare you send soldiers to your own mother?

841
01:38:17,950 --> 01:38:22,300
I must be a puppet King.

842
01:38:23,850 --> 01:38:31,950
How much did you like that place? 
Cutting off my four limbs and making me a puppet.

843
01:38:33,580 --> 01:38:35,860
Now you are trying to get rid of me?

844
01:38:36,080 --> 01:38:37,880
What are you talking about?

845
01:38:42,360 --> 01:38:44,720
Did you order me to be poisoned?

846
01:38:46,130 --> 01:38:47,590
Your Majesty.

847
01:38:48,710 --> 01:38:51,210
The royal doctor has already confessed everything.

848
01:38:52,280 --> 01:38:55,620
You conspireed with Yoon-jungho Minister and tried to kill me?

849
01:38:57,100 --> 01:39:00,620
What? You are speaking nonsense ...

850
01:39:00,620 --> 01:39:05,200
Right?  I also couldn't understand it.

851
01:39:06,890 --> 01:39:11,330
Your man, Yoon-jungho Minister, 
couldn't have conspire by himself.

852
01:39:13,310 --> 01:39:15,040
This is slander.

853
01:39:18,040 --> 01:39:20,030
This must be Soo-yong Queen's doing.

854
01:39:20,510 --> 01:39:22,360
That bitch, I will just ...

855
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:35,180
Oh ... ok.  I understand it all now.  
Make her the villain by putting poison in the medicine.

856
01:39:38,150 --> 01:39:43,330
Kill me, then kill Soo-yong Queen and the young prince as well.

857
01:39:46,360 --> 01:39:49,400
Who were you going to use to fill this empty space?

858
01:39:49,700 --> 01:39:51,490
What are you saying?

859
01:39:53,560 --> 01:39:58,010
The Yoon-jungho Minister and I have lived to put you on the throne.

860
01:40:01,290 --> 01:40:04,850
Truly, you have lasted a long time.

861
01:40:07,250 --> 01:40:08,200
Kill her.

862
01:40:08,330 --> 01:40:08,930
Yes sir.

863
01:40:18,660 --> 01:40:19,980
Who are you people?

864
01:40:28,940 --> 01:40:33,780
Go away!  Kill them all.

865
01:40:39,350 --> 01:40:43,440
Do not spare any of the traitors.  Kill them all.

866
01:40:43,440 --> 01:40:45,100
Yes sir.

867
01:41:08,470 --> 01:41:11,330
Do you know what a bitch Soo-yong Queen is?

868
01:41:12,210 --> 01:41:14,470
The late king could not have a child.

869
01:41:14,610 --> 01:41:17,220
Can't you tell the truth for once?

870
01:41:21,110 --> 01:41:26,160
Did you already forget?  Your King died after the birth as well.

871
01:41:29,200 --> 01:41:36,460
After that, I used the medicine on the late king. 
Although I was suspicious of the pregnancy.

872
01:41:39,080 --> 01:41:43,050
Po ... poison.  Did you use the poison on him?

873
01:41:52,940 --> 01:41:55,130
Who told you to do such an act?

874
01:41:55,640 --> 01:42:01,960
For whom ... For whom did you do such an act?

875
01:42:04,930 --> 01:42:09,280
When did I ever tell you that I wanted to be the King?

876
01:42:10,190 --> 01:42:13,570
When did I ever tell you I wanted to be the King?!

877
01:42:17,750 --> 01:42:20,670
Baby.  Look at me.

878
01:42:28,230 --> 01:42:35,590
I'm the mother who protected you from this turbulent palace.

879
01:42:41,490 --> 01:42:49,440
Why did you make me a King, 
and turn me into a person who can't trust you.

880
01:42:50,430 --> 01:42:53,060
Can you not trust your own mother?

881
01:43:00,090 --> 01:43:03,950
Truly, will you go against your mother's will?

882
01:43:08,840 --> 01:43:13,160
When we face them we shall find the truth.

883
01:43:14,140 --> 01:43:15,940
Is there anyone outside?

884
01:43:17,250 --> 01:43:21,490
Bring in Yoon-jungho Minister and Kwon-yoo.

885
01:43:21,650 --> 01:43:22,990
That won't happen.

886
01:43:22,990 --> 01:43:25,180
I will make sure that it happens.

887
01:43:30,140 --> 01:43:31,360
Yoon Minister.

888
01:43:42,720 --> 01:43:47,760
As the head eunuch, I've followed your orders 
and brought the wrongdoers.

889
01:43:51,340 --> 01:43:53,390
This person has confessed the truth.

890
01:43:54,720 --> 01:43:57,060
Also, the proof was  found in his quarters.

891
01:43:57,500 --> 01:44:00,070
Who do you think the royal doctor identified 
as the source of the poison?

892
01:44:00,080 --> 01:44:04,060
How should I know that?

893
01:44:04,060 --> 01:44:05,980
Why can't you say it?

894
01:44:06,500 --> 01:44:08,900
I know nothing about the matter.

895
01:44:09,640 --> 01:44:13,680
Aren't I the one who drank the medicine?

896
01:44:13,680 --> 01:44:13,690
Then you want me to ask you why you hesitated 
when I ask you to drink the medicine?
Aren't I the one who drank the medicine?

897
01:44:13,690 --> 01:44:18,220
Then you want me to ask you why you hesitated 
when I ask you to drink the medicine?

898
01:44:18,850 --> 01:44:20,890
You already knew about the poison in the medicine.

899
01:44:20,890 --> 01:44:21,770
Your Majesty.

900
01:44:21,800 --> 01:44:22,720
That's enough.

901
01:44:22,720 --> 01:44:26,000
I'm the one who is asking this eunuch.

902
01:44:27,940 --> 01:44:29,920
You definitely knew about it.

903
01:44:30,650 --> 01:44:33,000
How did you know about the poison in the medicine?

904
01:44:33,420 --> 01:44:36,940
Your Majesty, don't you know what a bitch Soo-yong Queen is?

905
01:44:38,670 --> 01:44:44,350
That eunuch and the bitch conspire together 
to ruin the kingdom together ...

906
01:44:45,120 --> 01:44:47,710
You need to bring her in to confess right now.

907
01:44:48,440 --> 01:44:49,740
That's right.

908
01:44:51,260 --> 01:44:53,340
I am the wrongdoer.

909
01:44:53,820 --> 01:44:59,730
I have wronged by conceiving a prince 
by the late King, as well as by being alive.

910
01:44:59,730 --> 01:45:04,330
You have indeed.  Using a prince to ruin this kingdom 
is indeed a wrong doing.

911
01:45:05,030 --> 01:45:08,000
Also, troubling your king by being alive is wrong doing.

912
01:45:10,720 --> 01:45:20,490
However Your Majesty, who is that person? He is the underling 
of the one who's responsible for my father's death.

913
01:45:21,280 --> 01:45:27,280
How can anyone in this world conspire together 
with the person who's responsible for your father's death.

914
01:45:27,280 --> 01:45:32,000
You bitch.  How dare you show fake tears?!

915
01:45:32,370 --> 01:45:35,430
What would a little one know and what could he possibly do?

916
01:45:35,430 --> 01:45:45,930
How can I be ambitions for your position?  
I would rather choose death by biting my own tongue.

917
01:45:45,930 --> 01:45:53,030
However, I could not die with a misunderstanding.

918
01:45:57,950 --> 01:45:59,870
Tell the truth with your own tongue.

919
01:45:59,870 --> 01:46:03,080
Who ordered you to put poison in the medicine?

920
01:46:18,690 --> 01:46:26,470
The Queen Mother asked me to make the poison.

921
01:46:27,100 --> 01:46:32,070
With that poison Yoon-jungho Minister has ...

922
01:46:32,110 --> 01:46:33,410
This is slander.

923
01:46:36,980 --> 01:46:37,970
Your Majesty.

924
01:46:38,630 --> 01:46:40,060
What are you doing?

925
01:46:42,260 --> 01:46:50,170
Why did you do it?  
You wanted this throne so much you wanted to kill me for it?!

926
01:46:50,180 --> 01:46:52,100
Tell me.

927
01:46:52,470 --> 01:46:54,100
You must calm down.

928
01:46:54,340 --> 01:46:55,920
The Queen Mother is losing breath.

929
01:46:56,220 --> 01:46:57,520
Your Majesty.

930
01:47:04,510 --> 01:47:10,070
Except him, take the others and kill them all.

931
01:47:10,070 --> 01:47:15,010
As for the Queen Mother, do not let her out of her quarters.

932
01:47:15,010 --> 01:47:23,300
If there is anyone who tries to contact her,
 I will punish them with the most severe punishment.

933
01:47:24,840 --> 01:47:31,940
Your Majesty. Your Majesty.  I'm innocent, Your Majesty.

934
01:47:38,430 --> 01:47:40,640
Thank you for keeping your promise.

935
01:47:41,570 --> 01:47:44,540
I will always remember your good deed.

936
01:47:49,450 --> 01:47:52,750
Please protect our child.

937
01:47:59,240 --> 01:48:00,820
Our child?

938
01:48:02,460 --> 01:48:08,140
The Prince is no one's child.  He is my child.

939
01:49:04,540 --> 01:49:09,530
When you become a real King ... you may come back.

940
01:49:34,310 --> 01:49:36,230
Is is all done now?

941
01:49:37,490 --> 01:49:40,730
Would you take me now?

942
01:55:54,010 --> 01:56:08,410
The King has passed. The King has passed.  The King has passed.

943
01:56:08,410 --> 01:56:22,630
... You must control your own mind in order to put 
your best effort into the care for the well of the nation.

944
01:56:23,050 --> 01:56:25,550
Do you understand me?

945
01:56:26,090 --> 01:56:27,840
Your Highness.

946
01:56:32,510 --> 01:56:34,790
Has it actually happened?

947
01:56:36,760 --> 01:56:38,980
I'm so sorry, Your Highness.

948
01:56:41,680 --> 01:56:45,980
Then, you came to fetch me.

949
01:56:52,230 --> 01:56:53,780
I have a favor to ask you.
