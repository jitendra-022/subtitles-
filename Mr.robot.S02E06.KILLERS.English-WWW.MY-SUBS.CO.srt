﻿1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,135
I don't have many options.
Someone's closing in on us.

2
00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:04,930
I have to find out what they know.

3
00:00:04,955 --> 00:00:07,790
- What exactly are you doing?
- I'm hacking the FBI.

4
00:00:07,791 --> 00:00:10,392
With the FBI at Evil Corp,
physical security is madness.

5
00:00:10,427 --> 00:00:12,728
It's Angela. She's our only option.

6
00:00:12,763 --> 00:00:15,564
- Did you talk to the FBI?
- This is simple.

7
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:17,766
I'll give you a small device
which you'll take to work.

8
00:00:17,801 --> 00:00:20,769
Drop at the Fed's office on the
23rd floor, and walk away.

9
00:00:20,804 --> 00:00:22,704
We have no other options;
the president can't

10
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:24,873
go to Congress with a bailout right now.

11
00:00:24,908 --> 00:00:26,541
Let me know when you've
locked up the votes.

12
00:00:26,577 --> 00:00:27,642
What are you up to?

13
00:00:27,678 --> 00:00:28,678
You're not doing anything

14
00:00:28,679 --> 00:00:29,978
on your end to help.

15
00:00:30,013 --> 00:00:31,213
Yo, yo, yo, yo, please buy my CD.

16
00:00:31,248 --> 00:00:32,314
He got into my system

17
00:00:32,349 --> 00:00:33,648
and he wants me to put the CD

18
00:00:33,684 --> 00:00:34,916
on one of the computers at work.

19
00:00:34,952 --> 00:00:36,318
Well, I guess I should pay up, Ahmed,

20
00:00:36,353 --> 00:00:37,986
before I get lynched over here.

21
00:00:38,021 --> 00:00:39,788
Let me guess. You're excited.

22
00:00:39,823 --> 00:00:40,889
Yeah, I'm excited.

23
00:00:40,924 --> 00:00:41,924
We get to go to China.

24
00:00:44,595 --> 00:00:45,961
Elliot, before you get started,

25
00:00:45,996 --> 00:00:47,562
I'm asking you to help me

26
00:00:47,598 --> 00:00:49,398
and not look where you don't need to.

27
00:00:49,433 --> 00:00:51,166
Are we really back to this again?

28
00:00:51,201 --> 00:00:53,602
Ray is not some coffee shop owner.

29
00:00:53,637 --> 00:00:56,138
Forget what you saw and move on.

30
00:00:56,173 --> 00:00:57,773
Hey! Hey!

31
00:00:59,443 --> 00:01:01,076
We're deep down inside you, Elliot.

32
00:01:01,111 --> 00:01:02,144
You can't leave us,

33
00:01:02,179 --> 00:01:03,645
and we can't leave you.

34
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,686
You're watching USA,

35
00:01:11,722 --> 00:01:14,022
America's favorite cable network.

What's happening?

42
00:01:57,835 --> 00:01:59,167
Where are we going?

43
00:01:59,203 --> 00:02:01,470
God, Elliot, what's your damage?

44
00:02:01,505 --> 00:02:03,038
Cool it, Darlene.

45
00:02:03,073 --> 00:02:04,973
You know your brother
needs our help sometimes.

46
00:02:05,008 --> 00:02:07,142
That boy of ours.

47
00:02:07,177 --> 00:02:08,643
You sure we're not first cousins?

48
00:02:12,449 --> 00:02:15,650
Where we're going,
Elliot, is a surprise.

49
00:02:15,686 --> 00:02:17,152
Can't say much else.

50
00:02:17,187 --> 00:02:19,187
What I can tell you is,

51
00:02:19,223 --> 00:02:21,323
it's a place that makes
everything better,

52
00:02:21,358 --> 00:02:23,058
a place that changes you.

53
00:02:23,093 --> 00:02:24,326
I should be so lucky.

54
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:28,363
I have a hunch that you
just might thank me

55
00:02:28,398 --> 00:02:30,899
once we get there.

56
00:02:30,934 --> 00:02:31,934
Why?

57
00:02:31,935 --> 00:02:33,768
What do you mean, why?

58
00:02:33,804 --> 00:02:36,771
This is the annual Alderson
family road trip, that's why.

59
00:02:36,807 --> 00:02:38,940
With all of us together,
taking on the world,

60
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:40,408
what could possibly go wrong?

61
00:02:43,747 --> 00:02:45,680
What's that sound?

62
00:02:47,384 --> 00:02:49,784
Say, Elliot, what's going
on with you and that girl?

63
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:51,887
I always liked her. Angela Moss.

64
00:02:51,922 --> 00:02:53,922
Oh, brother, kill me now.

65
00:02:55,325 --> 00:02:57,859
Me and Angela, we're friends.

66
00:02:57,895 --> 00:03:00,262
Ah, I see how it is.

67
00:03:00,297 --> 00:03:02,597
You two are just gonna
keep stringing us along.

68
00:03:02,633 --> 00:03:06,134
Elliot and Angela, a regular
will-they-won't-they couple.

69
00:03:08,272 --> 00:03:11,806
Uh-oh, sounds like that
cancer's acting up again.

70
00:03:11,842 --> 00:03:13,208
Looks like it too.

71
00:03:15,779 --> 00:03:18,647
What is that?

72
00:03:18,682 --> 00:03:20,615
That laughing?

73
00:03:20,651 --> 00:03:22,617
Mom, Elliot's hearing voices.

74
00:03:22,653 --> 00:03:23,919
What else is new?

75
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:28,089
If you're not careful,
Dad's gonna push you

76
00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:29,491
out a window again.

77
00:03:29,526 --> 00:03:31,259
Pipe down, Darlene.

78
00:03:31,295 --> 00:03:33,328
While I'm alive, you need
to treat me with respect.

79
00:03:33,363 --> 00:03:34,462
I'm your father.

80
00:03:34,498 --> 00:03:35,664
Not for long.

81
00:03:48,545 --> 00:03:50,612
Eyes up, son.

82
00:03:50,647 --> 00:03:53,515
See, on this journey of life,

83
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:56,117
it's best to stay focused
on the road ahead,

84
00:03:56,153 --> 00:03:59,154
'cause if you spend too
much time looking down,

85
00:03:59,189 --> 00:04:01,489
you might just end up with
a crick in your neck.

What?

92
00:05:41,992 --> 00:05:43,758
I can feel your bug eyes on me.

93
00:05:49,332 --> 00:05:51,032
Can I see your Game Boy?

94
00:05:51,068 --> 00:05:52,400
No way, you're not allowed.

95
00:05:52,436 --> 00:05:54,369
Your father told you to look ahead.

96
00:05:54,404 --> 00:05:56,004
And you, turn that game down.

97
00:05:57,941 --> 00:05:59,808
Are your fingers broken, young lady?

98
00:05:59,843 --> 00:06:03,044
Not yet, but in this family,
it's only a matter of time.

99
00:06:05,115 --> 00:06:06,115
Ow!

100
00:06:06,149 --> 00:06:07,582
You're burning me.

101
00:06:07,617 --> 00:06:09,417
So what if he hears?

102
00:06:11,021 --> 00:06:12,120
How about being more useful

103
00:06:12,155 --> 00:06:13,722
than your sack-of-potatoes sister?

104
00:06:13,757 --> 00:06:16,324
Mama needs a new pack of Slims.

105
00:06:16,359 --> 00:06:18,827
Lights, remember? I'm
watching my figure.

106
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:36,611
Somebody help me!

107
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:38,346
Help!

108
00:06:38,381 --> 00:06:40,582
Somebody!

109
00:06:40,617 --> 00:06:42,951
I'm trapped in here!

110
00:06:42,986 --> 00:06:44,786
I'm here!

111
00:06:49,226 --> 00:06:51,526
- No so fast, kiddo.
- Isn't that...

112
00:06:51,561 --> 00:06:53,261
Nothing but baggage, sorry to say.

113
00:06:53,296 --> 00:06:54,863
No, no, that was Ty...

114
00:06:54,898 --> 00:06:56,197
We're gonna have to get
your peepers checked

115
00:06:56,233 --> 00:06:57,699
as soon as we get home.

116
00:06:57,734 --> 00:06:59,534
In the meantime, go do
what you got to do.

117
00:06:59,569 --> 00:07:01,035
We shove off in five.

118
00:07:17,521 --> 00:07:18,521
I'm sorry.

119
00:07:18,522 --> 00:07:20,822
Hey, no problem, E-meister.

120
00:07:20,857 --> 00:07:22,190
Give me four!

121
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:26,227
Or not.

122
00:07:28,431 --> 00:07:30,231
Can I help you?

123
00:07:38,241 --> 00:07:39,741
I didn't know you worked here.

124
00:07:39,776 --> 00:07:42,544
Well, I started as a
part-time sales associate.

125
00:07:42,579 --> 00:07:45,580
Then they promoted me
to assistant manager.

126
00:07:45,615 --> 00:07:48,483
Now I'm on pace to be full manager.

127
00:07:48,518 --> 00:07:50,151
It almost makes up for
them killing my mom.

128
00:07:57,093 --> 00:07:58,860
Come on, son. Grab what you can.

129
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:00,562
Cheez-Its, Pringles, Jolt!

130
00:08:00,597 --> 00:08:02,263
What are you doing?

131
00:08:02,299 --> 00:08:04,532
Elliot, stop him, or I'm
gonna call the police.

132
00:08:12,209 --> 00:08:14,409
Can't worry about her anymore, son.

133
00:08:14,444 --> 00:08:15,777
She's one of them.

134
00:08:15,812 --> 00:08:17,712
No, she's not. She's my friend.

135
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:19,747
I promise, there are
other fish in the sea.

136
00:08:19,783 --> 00:08:21,649
And if you're anything
like your old man...

137
00:08:24,888 --> 00:08:27,922
On second thought, don't be
anything like your old man.

138
00:08:31,661 --> 00:08:33,895
All right, gang, let's pack
it up and hit the trail.

139
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:35,196
Together!

140
00:08:35,232 --> 00:08:40,068
Because it's one for Alderson and...

141
00:08:40,103 --> 00:08:41,703
Alderson for one?

142
00:08:58,421 --> 00:09:00,154
You guys'll never believe this.

143
00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:01,890
I just had the most messed-up dream

144
00:09:01,925 --> 00:09:03,825
that Mom slugged me in the face.

145
00:09:09,432 --> 00:09:10,899
I got to get out of here.

146
00:09:14,137 --> 00:09:16,137
Uh-huh, Buster.

147
00:09:16,172 --> 00:09:18,273
Eyes on the road in front of you.

148
00:09:25,782 --> 00:09:26,915
Ouch.

149
00:09:30,487 --> 00:09:32,287
Well, things suddenly
aren't looking so hot

150
00:09:32,322 --> 00:09:33,755
for the Alderson clan.

151
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:35,757
You screwed up another vacation.

152
00:09:35,792 --> 00:09:39,427
All it not yet lost, gang.
I have a donut.

153
00:09:41,031 --> 00:09:43,097
Just have to get it from
underneath my, uh...

154
00:09:45,969 --> 00:09:47,168
Baggage.

155
00:09:50,073 --> 00:09:51,439
Do you really expect me to believe

156
00:09:51,474 --> 00:09:52,941
there's no one in there?

157
00:09:52,976 --> 00:09:56,210
Elliot, come on. Not
this business again.

158
00:09:56,246 --> 00:09:58,713
You're really starting
to worry me, kiddo.

159
00:09:58,748 --> 00:10:02,216
Did you hit your head
during our little blowout?

160
00:10:02,252 --> 00:10:03,885
Enough of this shit!

161
00:10:05,922 --> 00:10:07,455
Tell me what's happening.

162
00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:08,723
What is this?

163
00:10:11,761 --> 00:10:13,828
Whoa, that doesn't sound good.

164
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:16,497
On the plus side, I hear
jumpsuits are in these days.

165
00:10:22,757 --> 00:10:24,883
In times of chaos and uncertainty,

166
00:10:24,907 --> 00:10:27,085
when the world feels off balance,

167
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:28,176
we look to those who've stood with us

168
00:10:28,211 --> 00:10:29,911
from the beginning.

169
00:10:29,946 --> 00:10:33,686
Since 1884, we've had America's back.

170
00:10:33,711 --> 00:10:35,234
We may get knocked down,

171
00:10:35,259 --> 00:10:37,159
but we'll never get knocked out.

172
00:10:37,184 --> 00:10:38,850
Still on your side.

173
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:43,719
Stay calm, collected.

174
00:10:43,755 --> 00:10:46,689
Follow my lead. It'll always work out.

175
00:10:49,694 --> 00:10:51,160
Car trouble, huh?

176
00:10:51,195 --> 00:10:52,728
He's onto us. Run for it!

177
00:10:54,299 --> 00:10:57,400
Gideon, you're alive.

178
00:10:57,435 --> 00:10:59,602
You folks haven't seen a clan of outlaws

179
00:10:59,637 --> 00:11:02,405
with a kidnapped corporate
exec, have you?

180
00:11:03,942 --> 00:11:05,107
Yikes!

181
00:11:11,449 --> 00:11:14,050
I kill me!

182
00:11:39,344 --> 00:11:41,110
Seem upset, son.

183
00:11:41,145 --> 00:11:42,878
Seriously, Elliot, it's been forever

184
00:11:42,914 --> 00:11:46,082
since that poor cop passed.

185
00:11:46,117 --> 00:11:47,984
It's been 12 seconds.

186
00:11:49,153 --> 00:11:50,720
It's time to move past it.

187
00:11:50,755 --> 00:11:52,488
Future is bright,

188
00:11:52,523 --> 00:11:54,957
endless like that horizon out there.

189
00:11:57,195 --> 00:12:00,329
Whatever you're doing
with me, I don't care.

190
00:12:00,365 --> 00:12:02,398
Just take me back.

191
00:12:02,433 --> 00:12:03,966
It's not that simple, kiddo.

192
00:12:07,038 --> 00:12:09,905
Someone help me!

193
00:12:09,941 --> 00:12:12,241
I'm a businessman!

194
00:12:12,276 --> 00:12:14,143
A very important businessman.

195
00:12:32,997 --> 00:12:35,064
You gonna tell me why you took him?

196
00:12:37,068 --> 00:12:38,601
First you're hearing voices.

197
00:12:38,636 --> 00:12:40,236
Now you're seeing things.

198
00:12:42,874 --> 00:12:46,208
He's right in front of us!

199
00:12:46,244 --> 00:12:47,777
We're staring at him!

200
00:12:47,812 --> 00:12:50,379
Am I the only one here
who isn't batfuck?

201
00:13:01,826 --> 00:13:04,460
It'll feel good if you let it.

202
00:13:04,495 --> 00:13:07,329
Believing it's real makes it so.

203
00:13:11,669 --> 00:13:13,235
Come on, grab him by the loafers.

204
00:13:13,271 --> 00:13:14,403
Oh, please, gentlemen.

205
00:13:14,439 --> 00:13:16,038
Ankles instead?

206
00:13:16,074 --> 00:13:17,540
The shoes, they're Ferragamo.

207
00:13:29,887 --> 00:13:31,253
Hyah!

208
00:13:44,035 --> 00:13:45,301
The laughing.

209
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:51,507
It's a lie.

210
00:13:53,077 --> 00:13:56,011
Sometimes lies can be useful, Elliot.

211
00:13:56,047 --> 00:13:57,680
Sometimes they protect you.

212
00:13:57,715 --> 00:13:59,715
And sometimes they help
you get away with murder.

213
00:14:05,623 --> 00:14:06,956
When the truth is painful, son...

214
00:14:06,991 --> 00:14:08,624
and it often is...

215
00:14:08,659 --> 00:14:10,426
a lie is the only remedy.

216
00:14:10,461 --> 00:14:13,129
'Cause too much truth, too much honesty,

217
00:14:13,164 --> 00:14:14,430
that'll kill ya.

218
00:14:18,102 --> 00:14:19,969
This whole place is a lie.

219
00:14:22,306 --> 00:14:24,273
Nothing here is true.

220
00:14:28,246 --> 00:14:29,545
Listen,

221
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:32,414
I know your gut's
saying not to trust me.

222
00:14:35,086 --> 00:14:36,452
But look around.

223
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:42,792
Everything you see,

224
00:14:42,827 --> 00:14:44,627
it's all here for you.

225
00:14:47,031 --> 00:14:49,665
To help you.

226
00:14:51,202 --> 00:14:53,269
You should try just going along with it.

227
00:14:59,210 --> 00:15:01,577
This is it,

228
00:15:01,612 --> 00:15:02,845
isn't it?

229
00:15:05,049 --> 00:15:08,083
You've won.

230
00:15:08,119 --> 00:15:10,319
You've taken over.

231
00:15:10,354 --> 00:15:12,688
What's that, kiddo?

232
00:15:16,894 --> 00:15:18,861
That's what this is.

233
00:15:21,399 --> 00:15:25,701
This road trip.

234
00:15:25,736 --> 00:15:27,903
This family vacation.

235
00:15:32,844 --> 00:15:35,778
I'm buried here.

236
00:15:40,818 --> 00:15:44,486
Well, I'll let you in
on a little secret.

237
00:15:44,522 --> 00:15:47,523
This is just temporary.

238
00:15:47,558 --> 00:15:50,626
We did always have a destination.

239
00:15:58,336 --> 00:16:00,202
After the beating you took,

240
00:16:00,238 --> 00:16:02,504
at least they got you to a doctor.

241
00:16:08,112 --> 00:16:10,279
You got yourself pretty messed up.

242
00:16:12,516 --> 00:16:15,584
If I were alive, I'd want
no part of that agony.

243
00:16:19,557 --> 00:16:21,423
Nobody's won anything, Elliot,

244
00:16:21,459 --> 00:16:23,359
especially not me.

245
00:16:25,296 --> 00:16:28,597
I'm just trying to help you
put it all in the rearview

246
00:16:28,633 --> 00:16:31,333
as painlessly as possible.

247
00:16:35,439 --> 00:16:37,206
Bring 'er in, kiddo.

248
00:16:45,549 --> 00:16:48,417
Now that the worst is behind you,

249
00:16:48,452 --> 00:16:50,119
it's time we get you back.

250
00:17:10,074 --> 00:17:13,742
Maxine, my dog.

251
00:17:16,247 --> 00:17:20,549
Started to develop a
cough two weeks ago.

252
00:17:20,584 --> 00:17:22,952
She got pretty frail pretty quick.

253
00:17:22,987 --> 00:17:26,221
Fell over a few times.

254
00:17:26,257 --> 00:17:28,590
According to the vet,

255
00:17:28,626 --> 00:17:30,159
she danced with the wrong mosquito,

256
00:17:30,194 --> 00:17:32,261
got herself a...

257
00:17:32,296 --> 00:17:35,764
nasty case of heartworm.

258
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:39,068
She was moved to a little
room off the basement,

259
00:17:39,103 --> 00:17:42,304
had a water heater for a roommate.

260
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:44,273
Before she got sick,

261
00:17:44,308 --> 00:17:47,643
Maxine lived like her own operator.

262
00:17:47,678 --> 00:17:50,145
Didn't seem to cross her mind
that she belonged to someone.

263
00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:55,084
But in that basement,
she needed human hands

264
00:17:55,119 --> 00:17:57,319
to give her every scrap of food,

265
00:17:57,355 --> 00:17:58,887
every pill...

266
00:18:00,958 --> 00:18:02,624
Occasional light.

267
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:19,608
For the first time, she realized

268
00:18:19,643 --> 00:18:21,343
that she continues to breathe

269
00:18:21,379 --> 00:18:24,713
because someone else allowed it,

270
00:18:24,749 --> 00:18:27,349
that she had a master.

271
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:32,788
Now, I'm no vet,

272
00:18:32,823 --> 00:18:34,823
but I think that realization
might have killed her

273
00:18:34,859 --> 00:18:37,326
before the parasites had a chance.

274
00:18:41,866 --> 00:18:45,367
Anyway, I'ma quit yapping,

275
00:18:45,403 --> 00:18:48,037
let you rest.

276
00:18:48,072 --> 00:18:49,872
Big days ahead.

277
00:18:49,907 --> 00:18:51,540
Work to do.

278
00:19:00,217 --> 00:19:02,184
We can sit here and complain,

279
00:19:02,219 --> 00:19:05,020
or we can go out there
and enjoy ourselves.

280
00:19:05,056 --> 00:19:06,522
I'm gonna sit here and complain.

281
00:19:08,459 --> 00:19:10,559
Well, not everyone enjoys
spending their vacation

282
00:19:10,594 --> 00:19:12,227
in a rain forest.

283
00:19:12,263 --> 00:19:14,363
We're in this rain
forest because of you!

284
00:19:14,398 --> 00:19:15,564
I vote we go home.

285
00:19:15,599 --> 00:19:16,832
You're not voting on this.

286
00:19:16,867 --> 00:19:18,033
Call the newspapers.

287
00:19:18,069 --> 00:19:19,401
Democracy is dead.

288
00:19:27,756 --> 00:19:30,591
It's been two days since
the shocking terror attack

289
00:19:30,626 --> 00:19:32,293
at Beijing's Bayi Lake Hotel,

290
00:19:32,328 --> 00:19:34,998
and while the exact death
toll has yet to be released,

291
00:19:35,023 --> 00:19:36,222
an anonymous source...

292
00:19:36,257 --> 00:19:39,058
Owning the FBI was never gonna be easy.

293
00:19:39,094 --> 00:19:42,328
But now... everyone's on high alert.

294
00:19:42,364 --> 00:19:43,863
We'll be fine.

295
00:19:45,667 --> 00:19:47,200
We only have one day.

296
00:19:47,235 --> 00:19:48,968
You heard what Angela said.

297
00:19:49,003 --> 00:19:51,671
An inter-office email stating
that the FBI's CART team

298
00:19:51,706 --> 00:19:53,573
is vacating E Corp tomorrow.

299
00:19:53,608 --> 00:19:54,874
We don't have a shot

300
00:19:54,909 --> 00:19:56,242
once they're back at the field office.

301
00:19:56,277 --> 00:19:57,810
She'll be ready.

302
00:19:57,846 --> 00:19:59,212
Darlene.

303
00:19:59,247 --> 00:20:01,013
We just started teaching her.

304
00:20:01,049 --> 00:20:04,717
For someone like Angela,
learning all of this in 24 hours

305
00:20:04,753 --> 00:20:07,153
is next to impossible.

306
00:20:07,188 --> 00:20:09,956
Uh... that?

307
00:20:12,594 --> 00:20:14,994
Okay, uh, you know what?

308
00:20:15,029 --> 00:20:16,896
It's... pause.

309
00:20:16,931 --> 00:20:20,767
Maybe you need to... sometimes
it helps to visualize it, okay?

310
00:20:20,802 --> 00:20:22,168
So here.

311
00:20:22,203 --> 00:20:24,937
Your network cable is gonna be plugged

312
00:20:24,973 --> 00:20:26,506
into one of these suckers.

313
00:20:26,541 --> 00:20:29,208
That's a battery-powered
home-brewed mobile tower

314
00:20:29,244 --> 00:20:30,777
called a femtocell.

315
00:20:30,812 --> 00:20:33,780
Now, this guy won't help
us get on the FBI network.

316
00:20:33,815 --> 00:20:35,848
That won't be accessible at E Corp.

317
00:20:35,884 --> 00:20:37,717
What this guy will do is force

318
00:20:37,752 --> 00:20:40,353
every FBI cell phone to connect to it

319
00:20:40,388 --> 00:20:44,457
so it can get every email,
text message, and document.

320
00:20:44,492 --> 00:20:48,561
Now, you SSH in, run the first script.

321
00:20:48,596 --> 00:20:52,565
Period, forward slash,

322
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:55,535
EnableAttack, space,

323
00:20:55,570 --> 00:20:58,538
femtopwn, space,

324
00:20:58,573 --> 00:21:00,072
WLAN0, comma,

325
00:21:00,108 --> 00:21:03,709
WLAN1, space, two.

326
00:21:03,745 --> 00:21:08,214
No... Uh, that's...

327
00:21:08,249 --> 00:21:10,082
Yeah.

328
00:21:10,118 --> 00:21:11,751
I will get this.

329
00:21:11,786 --> 00:21:13,553
Let's just try it again.

330
00:21:13,588 --> 00:21:15,621
Mm-hmm.

331
00:21:15,657 --> 00:21:18,458
Um...

332
00:21:18,493 --> 00:21:19,493
okay.

333
00:21:19,494 --> 00:21:21,627
This is a Rubber Ducky.

334
00:21:21,663 --> 00:21:25,565
All else fails, you find an FBI
laptop anywhere on the floor.

335
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,767
They're usually Panasonic Toughbooks.

336
00:21:27,802 --> 00:21:29,101
Plug this guy in,

337
00:21:29,137 --> 00:21:31,304
wait 15 seconds, then yank it, okay?

338
00:21:31,339 --> 00:21:33,506
Thanks to a tool called mimikatz,

339
00:21:33,541 --> 00:21:36,409
it'll pull all cached
passwords and domain info in

340
00:21:36,444 --> 00:21:37,444
and save them on this.

341
00:21:37,479 --> 00:21:38,778
Won't give us everything

342
00:21:38,813 --> 00:21:41,080
but might help lead us somewhere.

343
00:21:41,115 --> 00:21:43,583
Just a backup plan.

344
00:21:43,618 --> 00:21:46,319
Okay. Let's try again.

345
00:21:46,354 --> 00:21:49,956
You can't teach someone
to hack in one day, okay?

346
00:21:49,991 --> 00:21:51,524
I don't know how we'll
be ready by tomorrow.

347
00:21:51,559 --> 00:21:53,459
- We need more time.
- Well, we don't have it.

348
00:21:53,495 --> 00:21:55,962
And once they leave E Corp, we're done.

349
00:21:55,997 --> 00:21:58,931
Okay, just keep working on
the scripts with Angela.

350
00:21:58,967 --> 00:22:00,766
Rinse and repeat, again and again.

351
00:22:00,802 --> 00:22:02,768
Wax on, wax off.

352
00:22:02,804 --> 00:22:05,705
Do whatever you got to do,
but this is happening.

353
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:07,840
Okay, the holdup on the femtocell

354
00:22:07,876 --> 00:22:09,375
isn't helping either, okay?

355
00:22:09,410 --> 00:22:11,677
I still need to load the
exploit, need to test it...

356
00:22:11,713 --> 00:22:13,279
It'll be here.

357
00:22:13,314 --> 00:22:15,648
Cisco's still modding
and swapping antennas.

358
00:22:27,729 --> 00:22:29,228
_

359
00:22:29,557 --> 00:22:31,573
_

360
00:22:32,734 --> 00:22:35,728
_

361
00:22:39,122 --> 00:22:41,012
_

362
00:22:41,333 --> 00:22:43,223
_

363
00:22:44,075 --> 00:22:48,161
_

364
00:22:51,629 --> 00:22:53,997
_

365
00:22:54,723 --> 00:22:57,145
_

366
00:22:57,278 --> 00:23:01,317
_

367
00:23:02,895 --> 00:23:05,653
_

368
00:23:05,958 --> 00:23:08,348
_

369
00:23:08,481 --> 00:23:12,090
_

370
00:23:12,653 --> 00:23:15,122
_

371
00:23:21,282 --> 00:23:22,582
Really, man?

372
00:23:22,617 --> 00:23:24,417
I thought we were on the same team.

373
00:23:24,452 --> 00:23:26,519
Wait, wait, wait, wait. No, no, no, no.

374
00:23:26,554 --> 00:23:28,120
What the fuck, Xun?

375
00:23:28,156 --> 00:23:30,122
What the fuck is going on?

376
00:23:30,158 --> 00:23:33,793
Get off me, man! Xun,
what the hell's going on?

377
00:23:33,828 --> 00:23:37,263
Xun, Xun, just wait. The
fuck's going on, man?

378
00:23:37,298 --> 00:23:39,298
What the fuck is going on, man?

379
00:23:39,334 --> 00:23:42,134
Get off me. Get off me.

380
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:43,402
Fuck, dude.

381
00:23:43,438 --> 00:23:45,004
Get off me, man.

382
00:23:45,122 --> 00:23:47,856
_

383
00:23:47,881 --> 00:23:48,942
_

384
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:50,710
No, no, stop, stop, stop. No, no, no.

385
00:23:50,745 --> 00:23:51,745
No, no, no, no, no.

386
00:23:51,779 --> 00:23:52,812
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop!

387
00:23:52,934 --> 00:23:53,981
_

388
00:23:56,184 --> 00:23:58,395
 _

389
00:23:59,598 --> 00:24:01,164
_

390
00:24:06,067 --> 00:24:07,372
_

391
00:24:13,134 --> 00:24:16,502
Agent Ramos recommends
four weeks' psych leave.

392
00:24:16,537 --> 00:24:19,939
And you know I don't take
his evaluations lightly.

393
00:24:23,111 --> 00:24:25,411
You were also there.

394
00:24:25,446 --> 00:24:27,446
I was in my room.

395
00:24:27,482 --> 00:24:29,582
I got lucky.

396
00:24:29,617 --> 00:24:30,783
You were smack in the middle.

397
00:24:30,818 --> 00:24:32,084
You owe yourself some time.

398
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:34,420
I can't go away for a month.

399
00:24:34,455 --> 00:24:36,122
I won't.

400
00:24:36,157 --> 00:24:38,457
We disrupt the investigation,
the Dark Army wins.

401
00:24:38,493 --> 00:24:40,426
Chinese are pointing to a
group of Uighur separatists.

402
00:24:40,461 --> 00:24:41,994
I told you what I saw at the airport.

403
00:24:42,030 --> 00:24:43,929
What you saw doesn't mean anything.

404
00:24:43,965 --> 00:24:45,965
Excuse me, but I disagree.

405
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,867
We were there to investigate the hack,

406
00:24:47,902 --> 00:24:49,502
and then we were under fire.

407
00:24:49,537 --> 00:24:51,037
That is not a coincidence.

408
00:24:51,072 --> 00:24:54,607
By all reports, the Dark
Army are just hackers.

409
00:24:54,642 --> 00:24:56,308
It's not their MO to shoot up a hotel

410
00:24:56,344 --> 00:24:58,010
teeming with FBI.

411
00:24:58,046 --> 00:25:01,113
Violent separatists would
have taken more victims.

412
00:25:01,149 --> 00:25:02,982
I clipped one of the
shooters in the leg.

413
00:25:03,017 --> 00:25:04,684
He went down, hit the floor.

414
00:25:04,719 --> 00:25:05,818
He could have kept firing.

415
00:25:05,853 --> 00:25:07,219
I read the reports, DiPierro.

416
00:25:07,255 --> 00:25:09,355
He turned the gun on himself.

417
00:25:09,390 --> 00:25:12,158
He erased his history.

418
00:25:12,193 --> 00:25:15,027
And the other shooter
actually had me cornered.

419
00:25:15,063 --> 00:25:16,896
I was done.

420
00:25:16,931 --> 00:25:19,131
Swear to God.

421
00:25:19,167 --> 00:25:20,666
But instead, for some reason,

422
00:25:20,702 --> 00:25:22,201
he also put his weapon to his head

423
00:25:22,236 --> 00:25:24,837
and pulled the trigger.

424
00:25:24,872 --> 00:25:26,706
Their mission wasn't to slaughter us.

425
00:25:26,741 --> 00:25:29,675
If it was, I wouldn't be here
arguing with you right now.

426
00:25:29,711 --> 00:25:31,644
They were there to disrupt
our investigation,

427
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:32,845
to send us home,

428
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,947
and to leave nothing behind.

429
00:25:36,551 --> 00:25:38,350
I don't know what to say.

430
00:25:38,386 --> 00:25:40,419
Everyone's emotional because
of this Beijing thing.

431
00:25:40,455 --> 00:25:42,088
Revenge is on everyone's minds.

432
00:25:42,123 --> 00:25:43,889
The drums of war. I know you hear them.

433
00:25:43,925 --> 00:25:45,858
Be that as it may, Mr. Speaker,

434
00:25:45,893 --> 00:25:48,427
there are ways to drown them out.

435
00:25:48,463 --> 00:25:51,330
With enough passion, people
will buy into anything,

436
00:25:51,365 --> 00:25:53,265
especially at times like these.

437
00:25:53,301 --> 00:25:55,234
The Chinese tied our hands on this one.

438
00:25:55,269 --> 00:25:57,436
If I try to advocate
borrowing from them now,

439
00:25:57,472 --> 00:25:59,739
the American public
will call me a traitor.

440
00:25:59,774 --> 00:26:01,440
And, Phillip, frankly,

441
00:26:01,476 --> 00:26:03,509
I don't even know if I
disagree with them.

442
00:26:03,544 --> 00:26:05,411
Don't shit a shitter, John.

443
00:26:05,446 --> 00:26:08,180
You enter this pissing
contest with China

444
00:26:08,216 --> 00:26:12,184
instead of passing this bailout,
the country goes bankrupt.

445
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:13,586
Believe me, I would if I could.

446
00:26:13,621 --> 00:26:15,354
A bailout.

447
00:26:15,389 --> 00:26:17,890
No one can make that happen,
not in this climate.

448
00:26:17,925 --> 00:26:19,325
I'm sorry, Phillip.

449
00:26:22,797 --> 00:26:25,097
Minister Zhang's office
has been unreachable.

450
00:26:27,168 --> 00:26:28,968
That cocksucker.

451
00:26:30,505 --> 00:26:31,771
Well, call him again...

452
00:26:31,806 --> 00:26:34,106
and again and again and again.

453
00:26:34,142 --> 00:26:36,776
Don't fucking leave until you get him.

454
00:26:39,247 --> 00:26:40,579
Where's my car?

455
00:26:40,615 --> 00:26:41,981
I'm late for my next appointment.

456
00:26:42,016 --> 00:26:43,415
Sorry, sir.

457
00:26:43,451 --> 00:26:44,617
The driver's having trouble

458
00:26:44,652 --> 00:26:46,485
getting into the parking structure.

459
00:26:46,521 --> 00:26:48,788
Protesters have surrounded the building.

460
00:26:56,197 --> 00:27:00,199
Tell Bratton to summon as
much NYPD as is necessary.

461
00:27:10,511 --> 00:27:13,445
My success is assured.

462
00:27:14,448 --> 00:27:17,516
My success is assured.

463
00:27:18,553 --> 00:27:20,820
My success is assured.

464
00:27:21,823 --> 00:27:24,390
My success is assured.

465
00:27:25,526 --> 00:27:27,693
My success is assured.

466
00:27:29,163 --> 00:27:31,463
My success is assured.

467
00:27:33,968 --> 00:27:36,268
Um, you know you can't talk to yourself

468
00:27:36,304 --> 00:27:38,537
during the actual operation?

469
00:27:38,573 --> 00:27:40,139
Whatever it takes,

470
00:27:40,174 --> 00:27:42,141
as long as you're almost
ready for liftoff.

471
00:27:42,176 --> 00:27:44,476
We settled on midtown JW?

472
00:27:44,512 --> 00:27:46,478
23rd floor, Eastside View.

473
00:27:46,514 --> 00:27:47,980
This'll be during their lunch hour,

474
00:27:48,015 --> 00:27:49,648
so the floor should be pretty empty.

475
00:27:49,684 --> 00:27:51,884
Okay,

476
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:53,018
we're officially good to go.

477
00:28:05,099 --> 00:28:07,166
The hell is this?

478
00:28:26,187 --> 00:28:28,087
Nothing.

479
00:28:28,122 --> 00:28:29,922
I thought I recognized your friend,

480
00:28:29,957 --> 00:28:32,091
but I don't.

481
00:28:36,797 --> 00:28:39,265
I'll wait for your
call when I get there.

482
00:28:45,392 --> 00:28:46,485
Jesus.

483
00:28:46,634 --> 00:28:48,267
At least you still got
a few of these left.

484
00:28:49,603 --> 00:28:51,336
I cannot get through a day
in that E Corp building

485
00:28:51,372 --> 00:28:53,772
without juicing, you know what I mean?

486
00:28:58,279 --> 00:29:00,979
Hey, how soon till you re-up on, um...

487
00:29:03,851 --> 00:29:05,284
Everything?

488
00:29:05,319 --> 00:29:08,854
Oh, well, that's it for this place.

489
00:29:08,889 --> 00:29:12,491
I thought I could weather
the storm, but that's...

490
00:29:12,526 --> 00:29:13,659
I can't.

491
00:29:17,298 --> 00:29:21,266
I know it's rough out there,
but you're a survivor, Ahmed.

492
00:29:22,903 --> 00:29:25,637
Yeah, well, not when I
can't pay the rent.

493
00:29:25,673 --> 00:29:28,674
With this cash allowance,
no one's coming in.

494
00:29:28,709 --> 00:29:30,976
No customers, no inventory.

495
00:29:31,011 --> 00:29:32,811
No more of the best damn turkey sandwich

496
00:29:32,847 --> 00:29:35,514
in the tri-state.

497
00:29:35,549 --> 00:29:36,682
Heh.

498
00:29:40,054 --> 00:29:43,155
Man, I'm real sorry.

499
00:29:43,190 --> 00:29:45,190
Yeah. Thanks.

500
00:29:49,096 --> 00:29:51,630
Well, I guess I got to take advantage

501
00:29:51,665 --> 00:29:54,566
while I still can, right?

502
00:29:54,602 --> 00:29:56,568
How about it?

503
00:29:56,604 --> 00:29:58,971
Turkey sandwich on whole wheat.

504
00:29:59,006 --> 00:30:01,140
Oh, yeah, okay.

505
00:30:01,175 --> 00:30:03,008
Lettuce, mayo, Muenster.

506
00:30:41,749 --> 00:30:43,749
Yeah, hi, I'm in room 2301.

507
00:30:43,784 --> 00:30:45,551
I just used my last towel.

508
00:30:45,586 --> 00:30:47,686
I'm running out for a sec but
was wondering if someone

509
00:30:47,721 --> 00:30:50,189
could leave a few extras by my door?

510
00:30:50,224 --> 00:30:51,290
Thank you.

511
00:30:56,430 --> 00:30:58,430
Oh, hi.

512
00:30:58,465 --> 00:31:00,098
Oh, there's no conditioner in my room,

513
00:31:00,134 --> 00:31:02,467
and I'm sure gonna need
it with this humidity.

514
00:31:02,503 --> 00:31:04,736
You know how it is.

515
00:31:06,974 --> 00:31:08,707
Thanks, doll.

516
00:32:13,908 --> 00:32:16,375
Are we still on for lunch?

517
00:32:16,410 --> 00:32:17,709
Yeah, I'll be there.

518
00:33:08,028 --> 00:33:09,028
How's it going?

519
00:33:43,931 --> 00:33:45,697
Shit.

520
00:33:57,911 --> 00:33:59,211
Shit.

521
00:33:59,246 --> 00:34:00,379
What's up?

522
00:34:00,414 --> 00:34:01,913
The script, it isn't working.

523
00:34:01,949 --> 00:34:03,382
Mobley, are you on?

524
00:34:03,417 --> 00:34:05,650
Yeah, what's on your terminal?

525
00:34:05,686 --> 00:34:08,086
"EnableAttack not found."

526
00:34:12,192 --> 00:34:13,525
Everything okay?

527
00:34:16,330 --> 00:34:18,096
Angela, what's happening?

528
00:34:23,370 --> 00:34:24,803
Angela?

529
00:34:29,043 --> 00:34:30,675
I'm good.

530
00:34:30,711 --> 00:34:32,444
Okay, you have to change your path.

531
00:34:32,479 --> 00:34:35,814
CD, bin, hit Enter.

532
00:34:35,849 --> 00:34:38,083
- Done.
- Now run the script.

533
00:34:41,989 --> 00:34:43,922
And we are live.

534
00:34:43,957 --> 00:34:45,323
Wi-Fi interface is up.

535
00:34:45,359 --> 00:34:47,793
Communicating with femtocell.

536
00:34:47,828 --> 00:34:49,261
Good work.

537
00:34:49,296 --> 00:34:50,595
We're almost there. Do your thing.

538
00:34:53,233 --> 00:34:55,033
Is everything okay?

539
00:34:55,069 --> 00:34:56,968
Who the hell is that?

540
00:34:57,004 --> 00:34:58,203
Yeah.

541
00:34:58,238 --> 00:34:59,504
Fine.

542
00:34:59,540 --> 00:35:02,274
You were in there awhile.

543
00:35:02,309 --> 00:35:04,209
I didn't mean for that to sound weird.

544
00:35:04,244 --> 00:35:05,677
I just noticed because
I've never seen you

545
00:35:05,712 --> 00:35:08,313
on this floor before.

546
00:35:08,348 --> 00:35:11,016
I wanted to make sure
you're all right is all.

547
00:35:11,051 --> 00:35:12,717
We don't have time for this.
Get rid of him.

548
00:35:12,753 --> 00:35:16,388
Anyway, I'm Agent Ross Thomas, CY-5.

549
00:35:16,423 --> 00:35:18,290
Mobley, you're getting the transfers.

550
00:35:18,325 --> 00:35:20,859
Anything?

551
00:35:20,894 --> 00:35:21,993
Angela.

552
00:35:22,029 --> 00:35:23,361
He hails from San Diego,

553
00:35:23,397 --> 00:35:25,230
relationship is complicated.

554
00:35:25,265 --> 00:35:27,966
So what's it like?

555
00:35:28,001 --> 00:35:29,668
Knowing that every room you walk into,

556
00:35:29,703 --> 00:35:32,037
at least one person is quietly
trying to muster the courage

557
00:35:32,072 --> 00:35:33,705
to ask you out.

558
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:36,508
Jesus, end this before I hurl.

559
00:35:36,543 --> 00:35:38,243
Mobley.

560
00:35:38,278 --> 00:35:40,412
He's been in the Bureau
for under a year.

561
00:35:40,447 --> 00:35:42,314
Was infosec before then.

562
00:35:42,349 --> 00:35:43,815
I don't really think about that.

563
00:35:43,851 --> 00:35:45,584
Don't have much yet.

564
00:35:45,619 --> 00:35:49,688
Well, would you think
about drinks with me?

565
00:35:49,723 --> 00:35:52,357
Say, tomorrow night?

566
00:35:52,392 --> 00:35:53,925
I'm actually seeing someone.

567
00:35:53,961 --> 00:35:55,927
Oh, come on. I'm not proposing.

568
00:35:55,963 --> 00:35:58,330
It's one drink.

569
00:35:58,365 --> 00:36:00,165
I won't take no for an answer.

570
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:02,667
I'm flattered, but I really
have to get back to work.

571
00:36:02,703 --> 00:36:04,002
I've got something.

572
00:36:04,037 --> 00:36:06,037
He calls his mom a weird amount,

573
00:36:06,073 --> 00:36:09,241
and I will exploit that weirdness.

574
00:36:09,276 --> 00:36:13,011
This floor, it's
off-limits to non-Bureau.

575
00:36:13,046 --> 00:36:14,779
Did you know that?

576
00:36:14,815 --> 00:36:16,281
I thought you all were moving.

577
00:36:22,756 --> 00:36:26,591
Well? You want to tell
me why you're here?

578
00:36:26,627 --> 00:36:29,194
Shit, Mobley, I'm looking too.

579
00:36:29,229 --> 00:36:31,396
Angela, hold on a sec.

580
00:36:31,431 --> 00:36:32,797
I'm waiting.

581
00:36:34,768 --> 00:36:37,736
So that's all you got?

582
00:36:37,771 --> 00:36:39,471
A little brush-off and you give up?

583
00:36:42,576 --> 00:36:45,043
I just wanted a little flight.

584
00:36:45,078 --> 00:36:47,112
No one's ever handed a win.

585
00:36:52,286 --> 00:36:54,753
What are you doing for lunch?

586
00:36:54,788 --> 00:36:57,289
Busy tomorrow, but...

587
00:36:57,324 --> 00:37:00,458
I can meet you downstairs.

588
00:37:00,494 --> 00:37:01,826
Like, 30?

589
00:37:07,467 --> 00:37:09,634
I know a great Greek
place around the corner.

590
00:37:12,105 --> 00:37:13,872
I'll see you in a half.

591
00:37:19,279 --> 00:37:20,946
All right, you need to find a cubicle

592
00:37:20,981 --> 00:37:22,614
with a network switch under it.

593
00:37:22,649 --> 00:37:24,149
Should be on the ground.

594
00:37:24,184 --> 00:37:26,952
Lots of Ethernet cables
and flashing LEDs.

595
00:37:45,706 --> 00:37:47,472
Found one.

596
00:37:47,507 --> 00:37:48,873
All right, put the battery backup down

597
00:37:48,909 --> 00:37:50,475
and the femtocell next to it.

598
00:37:50,510 --> 00:37:52,711
Plug the battery backup
into a power strip.

599
00:37:52,746 --> 00:37:56,281
Do not unplug the femtocell
from the battery backup.

600
00:37:56,316 --> 00:37:57,949
After that, plug the other end

601
00:37:57,985 --> 00:38:00,485
of the yellow network
cable into the switch.

602
00:38:10,030 --> 00:38:12,330
Don't forget to wipe your
prints from everything.

603
00:38:46,967 --> 00:38:48,933
Okay, the femtocell's plugged in.

604
00:38:54,808 --> 00:38:56,541
You killed it.

605
00:38:56,576 --> 00:38:58,076
Go celebrate.

606
00:39:05,085 --> 00:39:06,551
Shit.

607
00:39:10,123 --> 00:39:11,856
We lost Wi-Fi.

608
00:39:11,892 --> 00:39:13,758
You need to get to a terminal
and bring it back up.

609
00:39:16,296 --> 00:39:18,229
Screw you. I did what you asked.

610
00:39:18,265 --> 00:39:20,065
If we can't get the interface to load,

611
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:21,766
then we can't use the
Juniper ScreenOS backdoor

612
00:39:21,802 --> 00:39:23,535
to own the network,

613
00:39:23,570 --> 00:39:24,936
which means I can't wipe
the security footage

614
00:39:24,971 --> 00:39:26,271
of you planting the femtocell.

615
00:39:26,306 --> 00:39:27,572
You're fucking kidding me.

616
00:39:27,607 --> 00:39:28,707
Just get to your cubicle.

617
00:39:28,742 --> 00:39:30,442
I'll walk you through it.

618
00:39:52,055 --> 00:39:54,823
Masters. We all have them.

619
00:39:54,859 --> 00:39:58,227
Every relationship's a power struggle.

620
00:39:58,262 --> 00:40:01,463
Some of us need to be controlled.

621
00:40:01,499 --> 00:40:04,466
Once in a while, the
best course of action

622
00:40:04,502 --> 00:40:07,069
is to just ride shotgun.

623
00:40:07,104 --> 00:40:09,171
Stare at the road ahead,

624
00:40:09,207 --> 00:40:11,407
and hope it leads
somewhere you want to go.

625
00:40:21,719 --> 00:40:23,819
There's a USB flash drive in that bag.

626
00:40:23,854 --> 00:40:26,255
When you get to your cubicle,
power off your machine,

627
00:40:26,290 --> 00:40:29,325
plug the flash drive in,
and power it back on.

628
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:31,827
Hold F12 to bring up your boot options.

629
00:40:31,862 --> 00:40:34,296
Make sure you boot from USB.

630
00:40:37,535 --> 00:40:40,469
Make sure live AMD64 is highlighted,

631
00:40:40,504 --> 00:40:43,172
then hit Enter.

632
00:40:43,207 --> 00:40:45,474
When the desktop comes
up, open a terminal.

633
00:40:45,509 --> 00:40:47,042
Click on the icon of the black screen,

634
00:40:47,078 --> 00:40:50,813
just like you practiced.

635
00:40:50,848 --> 00:40:52,448
Okay, now I need you
to type the following:

636
00:40:52,483 --> 00:40:54,483
SSH, space,

637
00:40:54,518 --> 00:40:56,518
dash L, space,

638
00:40:56,554 --> 00:40:58,187
root, space,

639
00:40:58,222 --> 00:41:04,222
L4713116.e-corp-usa.com.

640
00:41:17,441 --> 00:41:19,575
I lost my place.

641
00:41:19,610 --> 00:41:21,677
The last thing that I entered was three.

642
00:41:21,712 --> 00:41:25,714
116.e-corp-usa.com.

643
00:41:27,752 --> 00:41:28,752
Okay.

644
00:41:28,786 --> 00:41:30,552
Okay, password: joshua.

645
00:41:32,790 --> 00:41:34,156
Homestretch... you're
gonna have to bring up

646
00:41:34,191 --> 00:41:35,724
both Wi-Fi interfaces.

647
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:37,760
Ifconfig, space,

648
00:41:37,795 --> 00:41:40,329
WLAN0, space, up.

649
00:41:40,364 --> 00:41:41,364
Done.

650
00:41:41,399 --> 00:41:42,399
Last one.

651
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:44,266
Ifconfig, space,

652
00:41:44,302 --> 00:41:47,569
WLAN1, space, up.

653
00:41:47,605 --> 00:41:51,106
Angela Moss, is that right?

654
00:41:56,614 --> 00:41:58,213
Oh, you in the middle of a call?

655
00:41:58,249 --> 00:41:59,448
I'm sorry.

656
00:41:59,483 --> 00:42:00,883
I hate when people do that to me.

657
00:42:00,918 --> 00:42:02,384
Go ahead. I can wait for you to finish.

658
00:43:15,226 --> 00:43:18,160
Before you get all bent out of shape,

659
00:43:18,195 --> 00:43:21,430
all I was trying to do was
take those punches for you.

660
00:43:21,465 --> 00:43:22,631
That's it.

661
00:43:38,883 --> 00:43:40,749
Thank you.

662
00:44:15,886 --> 00:44:19,254
So if I had to guess,

663
00:44:19,290 --> 00:44:23,025
I'd say you didn't tell
Principal Howard your side?

664
00:44:27,798 --> 00:44:29,598
You know, it's okay to talk about stuff,

665
00:44:29,633 --> 00:44:32,167
to share your side of things.

666
00:44:34,805 --> 00:44:36,605
I'm here to listen.

667
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:38,273
Always will be.

668
00:44:40,444 --> 00:44:43,011
You don't feel like talking right now,

669
00:44:43,047 --> 00:44:44,546
nobody's gonna force you.

670
00:44:51,922 --> 00:44:53,856
Hopefully you're okay
with listening, though,

671
00:44:53,891 --> 00:44:56,091
'cause...

672
00:44:56,126 --> 00:44:59,595
I actually have something to share,

673
00:44:59,630 --> 00:45:01,864
something I'm pretty embarrassed about.

674
00:45:04,235 --> 00:45:07,102
Mr. Fitch, my supervisor...

675
00:45:07,137 --> 00:45:09,271
you met him, big bald guy,

676
00:45:09,306 --> 00:45:11,106
looks like that guy from "The Simpsons"

677
00:45:11,141 --> 00:45:14,476
that you don't like very much.

678
00:45:14,512 --> 00:45:16,745
A few Fridays ago, he
calls me into his office,

679
00:45:16,780 --> 00:45:18,280
sits me down,

680
00:45:18,315 --> 00:45:22,484
and immediately starts
reading off a list of dates.

681
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:26,455
September 8th, August 29th, August 2nd.

682
00:45:27,791 --> 00:45:30,459
Few more.

683
00:45:30,494 --> 00:45:35,297
He goes on to tell me that
because of these dates,

684
00:45:35,332 --> 00:45:38,000
my contract is being terminated.

685
00:45:40,170 --> 00:45:42,070
I was being let go.

686
00:45:42,106 --> 00:45:43,906
I asked him why.

687
00:45:43,941 --> 00:45:45,474
He didn't answer.

688
00:45:45,509 --> 00:45:48,110
He just thanked me for
my time, wished me luck,

689
00:45:48,145 --> 00:45:51,847
excused himself, no further explanation.

690
00:45:54,818 --> 00:45:56,985
What were the dates?

691
00:45:59,023 --> 00:46:02,524
They were all appointments
with a doctor.

692
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:06,228
I had to leave early
for some blood work.

693
00:46:09,033 --> 00:46:10,299
What? What do you mean?

694
00:46:13,304 --> 00:46:15,637
I'm sick, Elliot.

695
00:46:15,673 --> 00:46:17,839
That's what they're telling me.

696
00:46:17,875 --> 00:46:19,541
For a while now.

697
00:46:22,513 --> 00:46:25,480
I've been trying to
keep it from everybody.

698
00:46:25,516 --> 00:46:28,116
Your mom, Darlene,

699
00:46:28,152 --> 00:46:31,186
work, you.

700
00:46:39,730 --> 00:46:42,364
Come on, kiddo.

701
00:46:42,399 --> 00:46:46,001
World isn't gonna get
rid of me that easily.

702
00:46:46,036 --> 00:46:47,569
I'm gonna be okay.

703
00:46:50,841 --> 00:46:53,875
I'm never gonna leave you.

704
00:46:53,911 --> 00:46:55,644
Promise.

705
00:46:59,883 --> 00:47:01,049
Oh, come on.

706
00:47:01,085 --> 00:47:04,987
Enough of this gloom and doom.

707
00:47:05,022 --> 00:47:09,291
Why dwell on the past when we can
take a peek into the future?

708
00:47:10,427 --> 00:47:13,528
The site of my new gig.

709
00:47:13,564 --> 00:47:16,064
That's where I'm taking you.

710
00:47:16,100 --> 00:47:19,101
I'm opening a store...

711
00:47:19,136 --> 00:47:21,503
computers.

712
00:47:21,538 --> 00:47:23,338
Everybody wants to have one.

713
00:47:23,374 --> 00:47:24,573
We love 'em.

714
00:47:24,608 --> 00:47:26,375
Figured it made sense.

715
00:47:26,410 --> 00:47:27,943
You're gonna have a computer store?

716
00:47:27,978 --> 00:47:30,212
Mm-hmm.

717
00:47:30,247 --> 00:47:33,715
Can I work there?

718
00:47:33,751 --> 00:47:36,918
Yeah, don't see why not.

719
00:47:36,954 --> 00:47:39,888
In fact, I will give you your
first assignment right now.

720
00:47:39,923 --> 00:47:42,924
I want you to come up with a name.

721
00:47:45,829 --> 00:47:49,364
What? Stores need a name, right?

722
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:52,100
I can name it whatever I want?

723
00:47:52,136 --> 00:47:53,301
All right, tell you what.

724
00:47:53,337 --> 00:47:55,203
When we pull up,

725
00:47:55,239 --> 00:47:58,774
the first thing that
comes into your mind,

726
00:47:58,809 --> 00:48:01,977
that'll be the name.

727
00:48:02,012 --> 00:48:03,378
Really?

728
00:48:07,317 --> 00:48:10,085
Now, it's coming up here on the right.

729
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:12,554
Just keep those eyes on the road.

730
00:48:21,865 --> 00:48:24,399
Now, I don't have the keys yet,

731
00:48:24,435 --> 00:48:27,769
so we can't go in.

732
00:48:27,805 --> 00:48:29,438
I just closed on the place.

733
00:48:29,473 --> 00:48:32,474
It's a bit of a fixer-upper,
but it'll get there.

734
00:48:34,545 --> 00:48:36,445
It's awesome.

735
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:38,213
Thought you'd like it.

736
00:48:42,219 --> 00:48:45,454
Hey, uh, back there,

737
00:48:45,489 --> 00:48:47,689
what we talked about,

738
00:48:47,725 --> 00:48:50,425
let's just keep that between us, okay?

739
00:48:50,461 --> 00:48:51,461
Don't even tell your mom.

740
00:48:51,495 --> 00:48:54,162
Just our little secret.

741
00:48:58,802 --> 00:49:00,302
Good.

742
00:49:00,337 --> 00:49:03,138
Now, you have work to do.

743
00:49:03,173 --> 00:49:05,941
This place needs a name.

744
00:49:05,976 --> 00:49:08,110
Now, remember,

745
00:49:08,145 --> 00:49:10,712
the first thing that
pops into your mind.

746
